* most of these pathogens are hard to detect in their chronic stage
	* IgM won't be positive for most chronic cases
	* 16x the IgG negative range upper-bound should be considered active
* **there is no single test that can prove chronic infection**, instead you need:
	* a combination of different tests
	* periodic re-testing to measure trends
	* expert analysis to match test results with symptoms to *guess* the state of your infection

## Lyme diseases
My (possibly erroneous) understanding is that if you _never had the highly specific symptoms_ of either of the 3B's, you are unlikely to have either.

The symptoms for each species are fairly specific so I would start there as I can't list everything. This seems like an ok resource to start: https://www.lymedisease.org/touchedbylyme-wayne-anderson/, or ask GPT-thinking.

#### overview:
- **Bartonella**: foot burning/tender soles, pain/tenderness all over body, gastritis or if you have cats and have been bitten/scratched could be signs to test. PCR on lesion/lymph node biopsy + serology to confirm
- **Babesia**: thrombocytopenia (low thrombocytes count on CBC), jaundice, anemia, bad fever/chill cycles, SOB are signs to test. Testing should be done during relapsing fever, but I'm not sure in us immunocompromised patients fever would ever present. (Eg. I never had much fever in my life, even during an appendicitis, which should have been a red flag all along a it points to baseline immune deficiency.)
- **Borrelia**: not detectable in blood in chronic phase which is why blood tests are useless, as it wanders into tissue after initial acute phase. As to where, that depends on species - burgdorgferi: joints [arthritis], garinii: CNS, afzelii: dermatropic (but I'm sure there are exceptions), and so testing will be species dependent: for neuro-Borrelia you'd want a CSF tap + PCR, but for burgdorgferi probably synovial (joint) fluid is needed.

#### labs for all Lyme-related species:
* ***TLab RNA FISH**:
	* Seems to be the most advanced test as it detects pathogens in cells directly through microscopy and then RNA sequencing on the found pathogen is run to confirm.
	* However, it's very expensive ($600+ per strain, so testing all B's will run you several thousand), and probably not useful for Borrelia due to tissue preference.
* ***Igenex**:
	* possibly best serology option for bart/babs (again, useless for chronic Borrelia)
	* but serology can't confirm active infection (not even with the 16x rule, it's a heuristic)
* Walter Tarello does direct microscopy analysis (more legit than DualDur), need to write him on FB: https://www.facebook.com/p/Walter-Tarello-1003963308/
* IgeneX
	* high false positive rates: https://forums.phoenixrising.me/threads/study-finds-igenex-has-a-57-5-false-positive-rate-im-horrified.49417/
* TLab:
	* https://www.tlabdx.com/about-us/
	* full gamut of tests costs ~$3500

Note on the 16x IgG rule:
* I've met someone with severe immune deficiency with 3x confirmed Lyme/borrelia rashes but zero antibody presentation.

### Borrelia
After weeks of research my conclusion is that **there are currently no commercially available blood tests that can identify chronic Borreliosis.** The closest thing would be the TLab FISH test, but as discussed here before, chronic Lyme will likely migrate to the CNS and very little will be left in circulation, so for $4k or so this test seems to provide dubious value.

Likely if you do CSF PCR or brain biopsy you can get an answer.

I will just assume I may have it and simply focus on general immune rescue/modulatory and related treatments so that the body itself may take care of it.

* as of date no good solution to detect chronic Lyme
* CDC-approved 2-tier testing misses 70% or so of chronic infections → useless
* many other tests are too sensitive without enough specificity (e.g. DualDur, Armin Labs)

#### tests:
* Kronikler B16+ test https://www.deutsches-chroniker-labor.de/borreliose-testverfahren-zur-diagnose-von-borreliose/ablauf-des-borreliose-test.html
* GalaxyDX Nanotrap antigen https://www.galaxydx.com/nanotrap-urine-test-for-lyme-disease/
	* 100% sensitive for acute phase, only 41% for chronic (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634744/)
	* might be more tuned for US strains

#### species:
- B. garinii → neurotropic
- B. afzelii → dermatotropic
- B. burgdorferi sensu stricto → arthritogenic
- B. bavariensis (EU) → also neuro
- B. spielmanii / B. valaisiana → rare, causes EM

#### opinions/anecdotes:
> Lyme testing is notoriously tough. I don’t know why we can’t meet in the middle. LLMD’s will run tests that will give everyone a positive; then normal western testing has sensitivity that shows nobody on the face of the planet has Lyme. I’d be wary of Igenex, and the pay to play testing, as it seems everyone will come up positive. I’ve heard vibrant isn’t much better.

> peptidoglycan may be a reliable test it seems

> One of my docs (an LLMD) had me do a provocation with herbs prior to a blood test. Theoretically, herbal treatment kills some spirochetes, forcing their remnants/actual spirochete out into the blood, where they can be detected. It gave me my most positive Lyme test so far (4 bands), and a clear positive for Babesia. Followed the JHU in vitro research and used Japanese knotweed, cryptolepis, and Chinese skullcap. It also made me quite ill, so tread carefully.

>  I also wanted to mention that Armin Labs offers T cell testing for all of the above pathogens. The only benefit to doing this kind of testing is if you are so immunocompromised that your body no longer produces antibodies to Lyme (or X pathogen). These patients are referred to as seronegative. However, this test is not necessary for most patients, as they have a robust antibody response to the western blot/ immune blot.
