*Knowledge based on the experience of friends far more knowledgeable than me, as well as my own attempts and many hours of research, containing hard-to-find information from esoteric internet forums.*

> **Injection or capsules?** Most peptides are not bioavailable orally and have little bioavailability sublingually, so unfortunately you will have to inject if you want the full benefits. This guide focuses on IM (intramuscular) or subQ (subcutaneous) injections.

## Terms/slang
* *slin*: insulin
* *pinning*: injecting
* *reconstituting*: mixing
* *lyophilized*: freeze dried (basically powder form)

## Sources
* > Peptides are a legal grey area. Very few of them have been authorized for human use by health agencies (one example is Zadaxin – FDA approved TA-1), yet all of them are sold for "research use" – and that is how you can buy them. All sources will tell you their compounds are not for human consumption, which they do to stay legally compliant, but it is also why you have to make absolutely sure the ones you buy have third-party purity and content testing.
* types of sources:
	* pharma: purest, due to stricter guidelines, very expensive, hard to get
		* main difference: purified to [remove endotoxins](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/qingdao-sigma-chemical-co-ltd-international-us-eu-canada-and-australia-domestic.134407154/page-2736#post-3320308)
			* > UGL labs don't even test for endotoxins, 99% purity labels don't cover this. This is a risk-cost trade-off that you have to make.
	* UGL (underground lab):
		* in-between solution
		* usually your local chemist who can synthesize peptides
	* research:
		* more expensive than UGLs, cheaper than pharma
		* official businesses
		* not necessarily purer than UGLs
		* may get it through customs screening easier than unlabeled vials with white powder from China
	* Chinese sources: cheapest and often more pure than UGL/research
		* *can be 5-10x cheaper than research peptides*
		* they operate on low margins and high volume
		* these are sometimes official businesses, sometimes UGLs
		* even cheaper in group buys
	* > ⚠️ Only use 99% purity sources with many customers and a good reputation (esp. if going Chinese). Unless you can get pharma peptides e.g. in Russia.
* testing gold standard: https://janoshik.com/
	* > If you see a vendor frequently testing their batches with janoshik, it's probably trustworthy.
	* obviously not relevant for pharma peptides
	* always ask for third-party testing and CoA's (certificate of authenticity)
		* > ⚠️ Disreputable labs do in-house testing and cook results.
* some vetted sources:
	* EU: https://biolabshop.eu/ - \$\$
		* research
		* 97-99% purity, so I mostly avoid their injectables
		* I use their KPV and LA caps as slight impurity is less important when taken orally
	* UK: https://pharmalabglobal.com - \$\$\$
		* research
		* recommended by a pharma engineer friend I trust
	* US: https://www.peptidesciences.com/ - \$\$\$
		* research, but possibly purer than others
	* > If you know me, ask me for my latest UGL sources. I don't want to list them here in case this document becomes popular and attracts unwanted attention.
* dubious sources:
	* CN: https://nexaph.com/ - $
		* Chinese, unclear if they produce themselves or resell
		* used by some twitter mutuals but some concerns on [contaminants](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/introducing-spc-snp-nexaph-com-premium-usa-domestic-peptides-at-unbeatable-prices.134426803/#post-3340948) and [cherry picking tests](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/introducing-spc-snp-nexaph-com-premium-usa-domestic-peptides-at-unbeatable-prices.134426803/page-2#post-3341138), and an [overview](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/qingdao-sigma-chemical-co-ltd-international-us-eu-canada-and-australia-domestic.134407154/page-3743#post-3435143)
		* has recent janoshik reports
		* likely a drop-shipper that reships other cheaper UGLs

### Legality
* in some countries using experimental compounds for personal use, even steroids, is fine (e.g. UK, France), in others they are strictly regulated
* import of raw power peptides declared as cosmetic synthetics is legal in EU
	* substance has to be not lyophilized, not sterile, not in rubber top vials ready for injection → would count as medication, generally illegal
	* instead: screw-top vials with lyophilized powder: you have to filter/sterilize yourself
* prepare before making any purchases: check your local laws, read forum posts for anecdotes, ask experts
* if still unsure:
	* order small quantities each time, less suspicious during customs screening
		* higher shipping fees but given how cheap UGL sources are it's not a major concern
	* China UGL sources usually ship with innocent labels (e.g. "hyaluronic acid"), so chances are there won't be a problem
		* ask to make sure they do this if it's a concern

## All the things you will need to buy

### Bacteriostatic (BAC) water
* > ⚠️ Do **not** use regular water or even sterile water. BAC is needed to keep bacteria out, sterile won't do. Even BAC is not a foolproof solution, but it greatly reduces risk.
* > Components must meet USP specs. BAC also meets a specific pH range suitable for peptides, others may damage it. Even the vial materials need to be specific not to change the pH much, which is why I recommend Hospira below.
* ⚠️ do NOT buy BAC from Amazon, [see why](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/is-reconstitution-solution-good-for-tirzepatide.134428517/#post-3428006)
* [best] Hospira/Pfizer:
	* > Very hard to get as it's an rx product usually only available to licensed suppliers, even though it's "just" water.
	* [why](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/cheap-pfizer-hospira-bac-may-be-about-to-end.134428523/#post-3428386) it's superior
	* licensed medical suppliers that sell w/o rx: [US - currently the only one](https://medexsupply.com/water-bacteriostatic-iv-inj-sol-mdv-30ml-sterile-ftv-25-pack/)
		* US source but comes out to $7-8/vial with shipping and customs, while EU sources are usually $20-30/vial ([example](https://biolabshop.eu/accessories/133-woda-bakteriostatyczna.html))
		* it's a no-brainer in the US at $4/vial
	* > ⚠️ There are many shady sites asking for 3-10x this price or straight up selling fakes, which could be very dangerous to inject. This is not an area where you want to penny-pinch.
* [alternative] your peptide source may have purity tested BAC for a similar price or cheaper
	* $2.5/10ml is common with Chinese sources
* [advanced] DIY:
	* pharma-grade 50-100ml sterile water in vials - [DE](https://www.aponeo.de/00626544-wasser-fuer-injektionszwecke.html)
	* pharma-grade benzyl-alcohol, usually comes in 0.5-1L size for €70 and will last you a lifetime - [DE](https://shop.es-drei.de/alkohole/410/benzylalkohol-min.-99-5?number=S1004291)
		* needs to be: "Endotoxin Free" or "For Parenteral Applications" (Parenteral=for injection)
	* use a syringe to get 0.9% of BA into the steril water
	* [guide](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/eu-domestic-source-talk.134403344/page-133#post-3011607),  [additional info](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/is-reconstitution-solution-good-for-tirzepatide.134428517/#post-3429686)

### Syringes, needles
* > The idea is to use two types of syringes: one for reconstituting the peptide, another for injection. The former uses a larger needle (between 25G and 27G, possibly larger ones too) and can be either modular or a simple non-modular unit, while the ones for injecting should be modular so you can attach a filter and a thinner needle (29G or 30G).
* > For modular syringes, there are two connection types: [luer slip/taper and luer lock](https://www.apsf.org/article/managing-luer-connections/). Latter is preferred as it's more secure.
* > ⚠️ Only buy pharma-grade components, meaning they must be: **sterile (individually packaged)**, depyrogenized, non-toxic, non-latex (some are allergic to it), non-PVC, non-DEHP, & ISO 13485 compliant.

* syringe: 1cc/ml 100U luer lock: [UK](https://www.exchangesupplies.org/product/UX1L)
	* > 'U' stands for units, and you want it to be 100 to make dosing precise and easy.
	* > If 1cc syringes are more expensive than alternatives, like in my case, you can get 2-3cc syringes for mixing to save some money, as mixing needs less accuracy (usually increments of 1ml are used), while 1cc 100U is more important for injecting as smaller doses are injected (5-10U).
* needles:
	* > 'G' stands for gauge, i.e. the diameter.
	* pinning needle: has to be thin, 29-30G 1/2" luer lock: [UK](https://www.exchangesupplies.org/product/TY13)
		* if you have thick fat layer under skin, may want a longer needle
		* ideally low dead space for pinning needles (only important to save substance, not a requirement)
	* for reconstitution: you can use a thicker needle if it's cheaper: eg. 25-27G 3/4-1" luer lock: [UK](https://www.exchangesupplies.org/product/A235)
		* [alternative] one-piece or pre-assembled luer insulin syringe for reconstitution, can be cheaper

### Filters
* most guides don't mention this, but IMO it's a must: [rationale](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/qingdao-sigma-chemical-co-ltd-international-us-eu-canada-and-australia-domestic.134407154/page-3779#post-3439069)
	*  protein aggregates may form that can cause an unwanted immune reaction
	* there can be contaminants
* > I would use a filter with every injection. This makes it more expensive, but it lowers risk. You could also filter once during reconstitution into a sterile vial, but I couldn't find sterile sealed pharma-grade empty vials (don't trust Amazon). [US](https://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/ultra-spec-sterile-5ml-20mm-neck-clear-sealed-glass-vial-qty-1.html)
* > Many inject without filters and are fine, but you probably don't want to tempt fate.
* membrane material:
	* **hydrophilic**: to allow. water flow
		* (if you are injecting oils, not covered here, must be oleophilic/hydrophobic)
	* [best] **PES**: preferred, lowest protein binding capacity
		* > Low protein binding capacity is important to not waste your peptides.
		* [CN/global](https://shop.cobetter.com/products/sterile-0-22-um-pes-syringe-filters-for-sterile-filtration?variant=47858129305899) [DE](https://hornik.eu.com/de/3-134_spritzenfilter/9262-spritzenfilter-qmax-rr-pes-13-mm-022-m-ve-100-stck.html)
	* [alternative] **PVDF-L**: slightly higher protein binding capacity
	* **AVOID**: PVDF-H, PTFE, nylon or cellulose acetate
		* > These have high protein binding capacity or are hydrophilic.
* **0.2 μm (or 0.22 μm)** filters are best for sterility & removing protein aggregates without damaging the peptide structure

### Et cetera
* opaque box: to store peptides (both raw and mixed) shielded from light
* alcohol wipes: to disinfect the exterior of vials before reconstitution and skin before injecting
* mirror: for injecting
* [maybe] electronic pH meter
	* only if you mix special peptides
## Storage
* BAC:
	* unopened:
		* practically good forever despite expiry date
		* away from light
		* in room temperature, as alcohol may separate from water [in the fridge](https://thinksteroids.com/community/threads/questions-regarding-hgh-bac-water-storage.134426722/#post-3337741)
	* opened/after use: 28 days in fridge
		* > Recommended to get volume of BAC that you use up with each reconstituting so no there is no left-over that could spoil or that you'd have to waste.
* peptides:
	* in fridge
		* freezer not needed: might damage molecules upon unthawing
		* most consumer freezers cycle between low-high temperatures that may damage peptide
	* in opaque box, **away from light**
		* disinfect box with alcohol wipes before putting in peptides
	* shelf life:
		* raw: always ask source but should last 6 months in fridge
		* mixed: 28 days

## Mixing (reconstituting)
1. uncap BAC and peptide vials
2. wipe vial tops w/ alcohol wipes
3. pick new syringe w/ drawing needle (25-27G)
	* if luer-lock: attach
	* do NOT touch needle (use protective case while assembling)
4. remove air from syringe TODO link video
6. draw BAC water to desired concentration
	* draw upside down
	* refer to guide below on calculating desired concentration
7. inject water into vial:
	* ⚠️ DO NOT SPRAY water directly on peptide (MAY DAMAGE)
	* let it drip SLOWLY down the side of the vial onto ONE SPOT of the powder, not everywhere
	* probably don't need to push, vacuum in vial will suck water into the vial (but not always)
2. after injecting water, draw equivalent air from the peptide to neutralize pressure, then remove needle
3. gently roll the vial
	* ⚠️ DO NOT SHAKE (may damage)
	* let mix normally and do nothing, may take a while
1. wait until reconstituted (may take some time)
4. it is now reconstituted

TODO: min volume of water for solution

### How to calculate concentrations
1. note down the vial content
	* eg: 10mg
2. take your desired minimum dose
	* eg: 500mcg=0.5mg
3. calculate dose ratio: dose/vial
	* eg: 0.5/10=0.05=5%
4. note down BAC volume used for mixing
	* eg: 2ml=200U
5. calculate injection volume: multiply ratio with BAC volume
	* eg: 0.05\*200U=10U
	* this means you would draw 10U=0.1ml worth of mixed peptide into your 1cc injection syringe
* ⚠️ choose BAC volume such that the minimum injection volume is 5U=0.05ml
	* anything smaller will be very hard to precisely dose

### pH
* most peptides can be mixed with BAC (pH=[5,7])
* some compounds like NAD+ require careful pH adjustments
* TODO

## Injecting
1. remove mixed peptide vial from fridge 10 minutes before injection
2. use new syringe every time, w/ pinning needle (29-30G)
	* attach filter to syringe, then attach the pinning needle to filter
3. remove excess air from syringe
	* air bubbles: mini bubbles aren't dangerous
	* you can inject up to 1cc of air safely when **IM**  (but obviously don't do that)
		* but NOT SAFE when IV!!!
1. wipe mixed peptide vial, wipe vial top
2. draw mixed peptide upside down
3. choose injection location
	* IM locations: delts preferred, glutes [guide](https://www.spotinjections.com/index3.htm)
	* subQ also works but likely a bit less effective
		* need to roll skin into 1-inch fold of skin and inject there
		* see [this guide](https://youtu.be/LNXOFKjTPJc?si=gOyQY8ezvHIExqpd&t=179)
4. if you may faint from needles, sit down on couch where you can recline
5. wipe injection site (use different wipe): use circular motion moving outward
6. wait a little for injection site to dry, this avoids stinging
7. inject:
	1. relax and don't move or contract muscle during injection
	2. inject straight on (perpendicular to skin)
	3. make sure you push in needle fully, inject everything
8. wipe place of injection again
9. wipe vial tops again and put in fridge

> If you need a visual guide, [this video](https://youtu.be/I8WOHeoL1Wg?si=VaIN7eclzDvqpAhf&t=1020) from the 17 minute mark is good.

### Notes on injecting multiple peptides, IMPORTANT
* always use a different syringe and needle for each peptide
* ideally you inject into different locations or wait some time between each peptide injection
