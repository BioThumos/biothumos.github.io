TODO:
- gut health, probiotics
- bone health: L. retueri, calcium/milk, strength training, not sure what else
- methylation, other genetic deficiencies
- pbx: L. reuteri for improving bone loss, oxytocin, testosterone
- selenium: senescence?
- that new fatty acid they found missing in aging dolphins?
- draw immune cells, multiply them, reinfuse → possible to freeze and do later to regain immunity? likely doesn't fully work without functional stem cells to produce other types of cells and DNA damage buildup etc


## Immune
- high-dose pharma-grade omega-3
	- > This is the single highest impact intervention you can do (that we know of, based on current studies) to preserve lifespan and health-span, as omega-3's diverse roles in the body are so crucial. If you stick to the basics (good sleep, exercise, decent diet) and take high-dose omega-3, you got 90% of the things done.
	- best brands:
		- US/UK: Lovaza
		- EU: Omacor
		- best supplement alternative: Npure-3
	- dosage: 0.2g/kg, eg: 50kg → 10g, 70kg → 14g, 80kg → 16g
	- BID: split in half, taken 12h apart (for constant serum saturation)

**optional:**
- glutathione: opitac/setria/liposomal/IV TBD
	- synergistic with omega-3
	- NAC/ET likely better as glutathione is not directly uptaken by cells
	- possibly not the most bioavailable?

**maybe:**
- periodic aprepitant
	- light NF-kB inhibitor
	- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cc.7.5.5490
- alternative
	- leaves homeostatic NF-kB function intact but down-regulates excess activation
	- enhances insulin signaling
- periodic TA1
	- stimulate thymus
	- TODO: isn't this 
- stem cell therapy
- mtDNA release inhibition?
	- at old age, extracellular mtDNA levels increase for some reason
	- https://x.com/Madam_Mito/status/1963122158626091055

## Neuro
- creatine
	- 10g a day BID or TID

**optional (high cost, experimental):**
- ProdromeGlia plasmalogens
	- 8g loading dose for 1-2 months
	- 2-4g maintenance dose (depending on budget)
- selegiline
	- preserve dopamine receptors into old age
	- TODO dosage

**periodic:**
- SBT-272
	- mitochondrial membrane rebuilding, strongest concentration in brain

for specific mental health issues, see [depression-anxiety](depression-anxiety.md) 
## Metabolism: mitochondria, insulin, thyroid
> Apart from keeping the immune system from getting damaged (e.g. from [COVID](covid-protocol.md), the most important thing you can do is to keep your metabolism healthy.
 
> Some signs of a strong metabolism are that you can eat a large amount of calories without getting putting on weight, warm body temperature upon waking (related to thyroid), cold tolerance, naturally euphoric mood and "boundless" energy levels. For example, depression is likely a brain hypometabolism and chronic neuroinflammation.

* methylene blue
	* TODO: dosage
	* especially useful if you have ASD/ADHD with known complex I issues (MB bridges complex I)
- CoQ10 (Bio-Quinol): 100mg

**maybe:**
- SS-31
	- same compound as SBT-272, but doesn't cross BBB
- t3 micro-dosing?
- 

## Sleep
**chems:**
- glycine
	- > Glycine is a creatine precursor, helps keep levels stable, and lowers the needed creatine dosage.
	- 3g 1h before sleep
	- 1-2g with each meal (for gut and skin health)
	- ⚠️ if CKD or kidney stones: lower dose as glycine increases oxalate excretion through kidneys
- if you're above 35 → 0.3mg melatonin 1-3h before bedtime
	- > Melatonin production decreases with age

**habits:**
* wind down before sleep: do relaxing activities 1-2h before bedtime, ideally non-screen related (read, music, conversation, sex)
* avoid alcohol near bedtime, disrupts sleep
* simple to overlook: exhaust yourself every day, otherwise you won't be tired enough to sleep
* don't use bedroom for work or anything stimulating
	* if you are in a 1br studio, create a separate space for your workspace that you can close off eg via foldable screens

**environment:**
* prime circadian rhythm with light
	* sunlight upon waking, ideally sunset in evenings
		* not through windows → filters out important wavelengths
		* alternative: NIR red light therapy in evening
	* don't use overhead lamps in evening → prefer on-the-ground red lighting (ideally)
	* true NIR bulbs? https://x.com/anabology/status/1960384034879455260
	* ideal: incandescent light bulbs if available in your country
* use blue-light blocker glasses if you have to use screens
	* use night shift on iOS/macos and equivalent on other devices
* mattress:
	* prefer natural materials, ideally antimicrobial
		* natural latex is good, eg Talalay or Dunlap
	* softness? link study
	* TODO
* sleep environment:
	* total darkness
	* cool environment, 19-21C
	* ideally mattress cooling but I don't love 8sleep's subscription model and plastic mattresses, TBD

## Detox
* sauna
* heavy metal chelators TODO
* mold and other toxin chelators TODO

## General
- magnesium: malate in AM, threonate or bisglycinate in PM (dosage TBD)
- C: 1-2g
- D: 5k IU
	- synergistic with omega-3
	- taken in morning
- TODO: B vitamins, TTFD, methyl/adenocobalamin
- taurine: 5-20g (TBD)
- Thorne/Life Extension multivitamin TBD

## Bone
maybe:
- spironolactone? https://x.com/lee_hebel/status/1959147941811155003
## Parasites, pathogens
* periodic albendazole cure
	* also potentially useful against cancer
* candida/fungus TODO
* herbs to include in diet: TODO

## Infection handling, minimize risks
* IFN-alpha injections at onset
	* especially with [SARS2](covid-protocol.md), as it tends to suppress initial interferon response
	* alternative: cycloferon
* increase D to 20k IU for short period
* increase C to 1g every few hours (clears very fast so it shouldn't cause toxicity issues)

## Diet
* aim for mixed, diverse diet
* eat collagen-rich foods, eg bone broth
	* collagen + glycine for skin and gut health
	* if you can't eat it regularly: collagen peptides
* try to have major colors on your plate
* prefer ruminant meat
* liver 1-2x a week
* oysters 1-2x a week
* prefer A2 milk (easier to digest, suitable for many lactose intolerant people)
* eat fermented foods, unless histamine intolerant (or MCAS)
* coffee:
	* TODO include papers
* grains are not recommended but if you eat bread, prefer sourdough (cultured, ie predigested)

**AVOID!**
* linoleic acid and other PUFAs
	* except: olive oil (prefer extra virgin, non-mixed, from reputable brands)
* hydrogenized oils (similar to PUFAs)
* corn syrup
* anything processed in general

## Skin
- tretinoil sandwhich
- needling
- tallow cream
- GHK-Cu cream
- methylene blue cream

## Exercise
* strength training
	* > Muscle mass is the single best predictor for lowering all-cause mortality
* HIIT cardio

## Habits
* sauna
* daily walks, especially post-meal
* meaningful connections, purpose and contentment in life are just as, if not more important than all the things listed here, but that's a separate guide

## Environmental
* building quality/purity and indoor are quality are huge issues, TODO return to this

## Useless fads that might even age you faster
* metformin
* rapamycin
* veganism
* constant kcal deficit
* Blueprint
* HBOT
* NAD+ or NADH infusions
* intermittent fasting: might destroy your thyroid health
* keto: same, although it also helps some people, likely depends on your genetics and microbiome

## Startups and researchers to watch
- Dr. Michael Levin
- Mitrix Bio: externally grown mitochondrial transplants
- Madam Mito: good twitter account summarizing longevity research (but she is very neurotic & unpleasant, don't interact): https://x.com/Madam_Mito
- https://x.com/DocLarus mtON, optogenetics approach (use light to revitalize bone marrow mitochondria) https://x.com/TTIScience
