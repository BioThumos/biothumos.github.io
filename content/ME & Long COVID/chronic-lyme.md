- usual abx are only effective against the replicating forms, not against the latent phase (Zhang, Hopkins, Northeastern, Stanford)
	- TODO link paper
- effective anti-pathogenic drugs:
	- **replicating phase**: azythromycin, doxycycline
	- **latent phase**: disulfiram, methylene blue, compounded form of clotrimazole
	- **both phases**: rifampicin (potential game changer, great intracellular levels, good for bartonella, BUT interacts with everything so have to be careful)
	- unclear in which stages the below are used:
		- for borrelia/bartonella (?): clarithromycin (similar to azyth), rifampicin 
		- for babesia: add mepron, atovaquone, and/or arakoda
			- doxy/azyth not effective for babesia
		- others mentioned: cefuroxim, augmentin, amoxicilin, bactrim
- alternate between two phases every 1-2 months → unknown for how long
	- adds MB later: loves it, mostly replaced his disulfiram use
	- artimisinin sometimes
- crucial to fix the immune system
	- doesn't begin above treatment until MCAS is under control → decrease chances of drug reactions, also possibly herxes
	- interventions:
		- MB also helps to improve metabolism → immune system
		- rapamycin
		- TA1: 900 (mg? mcg?) 3x/w
		- plasmapheresis: improves immune function by lowering inflammation load
		- exosomes → herx
			- herx occurs from abx or immune cells killing the bugs
			- herx is evidence that treatment is working
			- lower dose on herx
	- thinks T-cell exhaustion is due to constant relentless antigen presentation
	- places higher importance on immune side than on direct anti-pathogen action
- doesn't retest during treatment because:
	1. TLab FISH doesn't quantify positivity
	2. negative tests lag treatments
	3. if pathogen is latent and we just want to suppress, they will likely be there
