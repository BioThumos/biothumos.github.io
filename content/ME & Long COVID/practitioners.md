This document lists people who are deeply involved in LC & ME/CFS research and treatment. While doctors knowledgeable about these diseases are few and far between, there may be others out there I'm not familiar with. I'm only including those with whom I've either positively interacted before, or those whom patient friends have recommended.

## Doctors & clinics

### Dr Michael Scoma (US & international)
* [Twitter](https://x.com/DrScomaME_CFS)
* https://michaelrscomamd.com/
* large cohort w/ lots of practical experience
* up to date on latest treatment protocols
* perhaps not as deep a theoretical grasp - he's not a researcher
* patient friends tell me he is quick to respond and really seems to care
* $900/consultation + infinite texting thereafter ("concierge service")

### Dr Murphy (US & international)
* [Twitter](https://x.com/TakeWeightOffMD)
* https://conciergemedical.ai/
* similar profile to Dr Scoma
* have heard from patient friends he is good
* \$300 first consultation, $250/consultation thereafter

### Mt Sinai / PolyBio (US)
* https://polybio.org/polybio-mount-sinai-collaborators-open-state-of-the-art-center-for-patients-with-long-covid-and-related-conditions/
* PolyBio are a research organization who have partnered with Mt Sinai
* this is the only clinic I have no familiarity with, but based on their pedigree in this space I can recommend them blindly
* main doctors (need to confirm): [Amy Proal, PhD](https://x.com/microbeminded2/) and [David Putrino, PhD](https://x.com/PutrinoLab)

## Researchers & research organizations

Although these people & organizations are primarily focused on research and not praxis, they may be open to consultation if you reach out.

### Nick Melia
* [Twitter](https://x.com/arta_semita)
* note: I'm biased as he is a good friend
* even so, he is exceptionally talented:
  * studying medicine since childhood
  * can deduce cellular mechanisms from symptoms, supplement and drug responses
* doesn't have a huge cohort yet but has helped dozens of friends to improve or even go into full remission

### Joshua Leisk / Born Free
* [Twitter](https://x.com/joshual_tm)
* https://bornfree.life/
* he has a more complete pic of ME than most docs
* Nick Melia praises him

### Remission Biome
* https://www.remissionbiome.org/
* research organization of doctors, researchers, and computer scientists
