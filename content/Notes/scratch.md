Where we run into trouble with rapamycin is that ME/CFS is highly cell-type-specific:
• Monocytes, many effector CD8+ T cells, and microglia tend to show mTOR hyperactivation → rapamycin calms these down.
• NK cells, certain exhausted CD8+ subsets, and macrophages (especially in patients with persistent viruses and/or high nagalase) already run on hypoactive mTOR → adding rapamycin suppresses their residual glycolysis, granzyme/perforin, phagocytosis, and antiviral activity even further → cytotoxic function collapses and latent viruses (HHV-6, EBV, CMV, HSV1, HSv2, Enteroviruses, etc.) can surge.
That second pattern is what happened to me needing opposite type treatments to bring back up cell activity rapidly to pull out of emergency type situation. So for some of us rapamycin ends up being immunosuppressive rather than immune stimulating. Both patterns are real and coexist in the same disease.
