## Sarah Myhill - fermenting gut protocol
- take 5g vit C a day
	- she recommends taking it on empty stomach to kill off mucosal microbes
	- one bolus: for convenience mostly, but it's stored in body for long time anyway
	- microbes are more vulnerable in morning (?)
	- liquid > capsules:
		- cheaper
		- plus cleans esophagus (rinse mouth immediately to avoid enamel damage)
	- first 25 feet of gut should be sterile
	- microbiome is in the last 5 feet
	- vit C doesn't get to the microbiome
	- if you get rumbling, smelly wind, diarrhea etc → overdosed, lower dose
- iodine
	- contact kills microbes
	- separate vit C (one is reducing, another is oxidizing agent)
	- before going to bed: 3 drops of 15% (Lugol's)
		- start low, go slow
		- the sicker you are, the slower you go (1 drop in glass, 1 sip)
	- gets absorbed by upper gut, never gets to the biome
- MSM
	- for sulfur deficiency → crucial for exclusion zone water
	- healing gut, connective tissue
	- detox heavy metals
	- kills microbes in upper gut (aerobic)
	- feeds bacteria in lower gut (anaerobic) - as prepbx
	- also go slow:
		- quarter of tsp → in 6 months: 30g 3x/week
		- not all the time → too effective at detoxing heavy metals, but also takes out other minerals
		- maintenance dose: half a tsp couple of times a day
		- replenish friendly minerals rest of the days
			- should be similar in composition to https://www.salesatdrmyhill.co.uk/sunshine-salt-300-g-392-p.asp
	- prefer organic ($30/kg on amazon)
- heavy metals testing:
	- use chelator → collect urine for next 6 hours
	- when using DMSA: also pulls out friendly metals in high concentrations
	- when using MSM: only toxic metals are pulled out, strangely
		- even aluminium
		- silica water also good for aluminium, likely better but not as expensive
- heating regimes to get rid of toxin deposits in fat
- coconut oil or shea butter on skin to pull out toxins from the subQ fat deposits

## David Kaufman & Ilene Ruhoy

- Ruhoy likes enteragem: expensive, 1-3 months should be enough, reduces gut inflammation
	- cheaper versions: SBI protect, IG spore, glutashield
	- enteragem is more potent though
	- sx treatment, not core
- SIBO treatments (Kaufman):
	- getting rid of inappropriate bacteria in small intestine: relatively easy
		- for bacteria: rifaximin, and another I didn't get (ryzafixin?) https://youtu.be/Uz_F6UQ628Y?si=UUoe3x75BJuU-peD&t=858
		- unclear how to address methane producing archae (not bacteria)
			- usual but not effective: flagyle, neomycin (plus sx)
			- cell wall is actually a dense cholesterol: lovastatin can disrupt it → works but don't know how long to treat
		- biofilm: enzyme supplements
	- preventing recurrence: hardest but very important (eg poor motility causes frequent repopulation) - PRIORITY
		- immunoglobulin
		- motility agents
		- nutrients for mucosal fuel
	- fix leaky gut
		- doesn't specify how
	- loves magnesium oxide!
	- motegrity if needed: can be very helpful at low dose but very expensive
	- diet: simple - low carb/sugar/processed
		- he thinks special diets are symptomatic treatment
		- and SIBO is not caused by diet, at most aggravated by it
- motility should be fast (daily bowel movements): the longer bacteria-infested food is in gut the higher the risk 
- motility fixes (Ruhoy):
	- stool softeners
	- magnesium
	- moving around a little (if possible)
	- anti-nausea medications: zofram, reglan → sometimes works well, not always
	- low-dose erythromycin: 20ml BID, seems to help, Ruhoy thinks low dose causes resistance, short pulses
	- octreotide
	- prucalopride
	- all help a little bit, no silver bullet
- once things get moving, may relapse at first → could be toxin release
- colonoscopy prep can help
	- don't do enema (not strong enough?), especially frequently
- they don't know what the best probiotics is
