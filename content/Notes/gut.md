## Dr. Kaufman & Dr. Ruhoy

- Ruhoy likes enteragem: expensive, 1-3 months should be enough, reduces gut inflammation
	- cheaper versions: SBI protect, IG spore, glutashield
	- enteragem is more potent though
	- sx treatment, not core
- SIBO treatments (Kaufman):
	- getting rid of inappropriate bacteria in small intestine: relatively easy
		- for bacteria: rifaximin, and another I didn't get (ryzafixin?) https://youtu.be/Uz_F6UQ628Y?si=UUoe3x75BJuU-peD&t=858
		- unclear how to address methane producing archae (not bacteria)
			- usual but not effective: flagyle, neomycin (plus sx)
			- cell wall is actually a dense cholesterol: lovastatin can disrupt it → works but don't know how long to treat
		- biofilm: enzyme supplements
	- preventing recurrence: hardest but very important (eg poor motility causes frequent repopulation) - PRIORITY
		- immunoglobulin
		- motility agents
		- nutrients for mucosal fuel
	- fix leaky gut
		- doesn't specify how
	- loves magnesium oxide!
	- motegrity if needed: can be very helpful at low dose but very expensive
	- diet: simple - low carb/sugar/processed
		- he thinks special diets are symptomatic treatment
		- and SIBO is not caused by diet, at most aggravated by it
- motility should be fast (daily bowel movements): the longer bacteria-infested food is in gut the higher the risk 
- motility fixes (Ruhoy):
	- stool softeners
	- magnesium
	- moving around a little (if possible)
	- anti-nausea medications: zofram, reglan → sometimes works well, not always
	- low-dose erythromycin: 20ml BID, seems to help, Ruhoy thinks low dose causes resistance, short pulses
	- octreotide
	- prucalopride
	- all help a little bit, no silver bullet
	once things get moving, may relapse at first → could be toxin release
	colonoscopy prep can help
		don't do enema, not strong enough? especially frequently
- they don't know what the best probiotics is
