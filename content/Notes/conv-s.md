## Ablify

If it’s Abilify, I just wanted to let you know that I have a friend who has remained mostly asymptomatic thanks to Abilify. Even after five years, it still seems to work for him. He believes that taking Amisulpride alongside it has helped prevent tolerance from developing.

I have no idea if that’s actually true, but it might be worth looking into!

## Reflux

Do not take PPIs. They will wreck you over time.

Try changing the diet. Go to the basics ( plain fatty meat), and then slowly find what you can add.

Take HCL and pepsin to lower pH and close the esophageal-gastric sphincter.

Take zinc-carnosine to create HCL and repair the mucosa 

Get rid of common allergens: grains, dairy, gluten, coffee,, spices, alcohol, etc.

And a very effective physical barrier with anti-inflammatory and mucose-reparative properties: 1-2 g of Sodium alginate 10 mind before meals. It will prevent bilis or HCl to go up. It is amazingly effective, more than PPIs.

Fast as much as possible. Let the mucosa heal. Enter into ketosis if possible

This just scraps the surface, but can be very effective for many.


## Iron

I would take  high doses of lactoferrin as it has shown to increase iron better than iron supplements in many studies. 

Iron is highly inflammatory and sometimes it is blocked inside the cells so you don't see it in blood bound to transferrin, especially when there is copper deficiency or with high oxidative stress and inflammation. 

You need to make sure that you do have a real iron deficiency to take iron. Also, it would be much better to take iron bound to heme by increasing red meat and liver.

If you want you can send me your iron-related tests results and I might give you better advice.


## Treatment approach

No single supplement or drug will move the needle. Only a holistic plan addressing the most important pathways will eventually work.

We don’t talk much about the basics here, but they are just as important—if not more—than any therapy.

After years of mitochondrial failure and immunosuppression, we are full of toxins and infections, hidden deep in the tissues under different biofilms, difficult to reach.

Specific individual triggers need to be removed, such as mold (both environmental and internal), heavy metals, pesticides, etc. Once the body can handle it, we’ll need to eliminate these toxins (sauna, chelation, Epsom salt baths, binders...) and replenish the nutrients we normally lack (Mg²⁺, iodine, lithium, selenium, copper...).

The immune system is constantly creating autoantibodies and attacking self-tissues. Similarly, we have many autoreactive T cells that cause ongoing damage and inflammation. We’ll probably need to eliminate the long-lived plasma cells to break this part of the cycle.

Our limbic system is stuck in an inflammatory state, sending danger signals to the periphery. If this doesn’t correct itself, we’ll need to intervene (transcranial ultrasound, peptides to reduce CRFR2, limbic system retraining—for milder cases, etc. ).

We also have plenty of alarmins in the blood and lymphatics perpetuating the disease, even in the absence of active infections (IFN-α, eATP, cardiolipin, mtDNA, PGE₂, TGF-Β1, kynunerin, succinate, etc.). These will need to be dealt with.

There is also excessive expression of viruses and retroviruses inserted in the DNA of somatic cells, constantly forming inflammatory microRNAs (HHV6, perhaps even XMRV or a related one, for sure lots of endogenous ERV which should be silent but they are not).

The gut is fermenting and leaky, continuously activating the immune system (T cells, B cells, mast cells, complement, etc.) and perpetuating the autoimmune response. Dysbiotic microbes produce toxins like LPS, D-lactate, ammonia, and alcohols that enter the bloodstream and inhibit mitochondria. This needs to be fixed (Dr Myhil's protocol for fermenting gut is a great tool IMO). 

Here eliminating all immunigenic and fermenting foods is paramount, obviously. 

So no, this is not an easy war we’ll win with a couple of drugs or supplements. We need a comprehensive strategy to address all these factors. But I am sure we can do it. In fact, in animal models this has already been done by targeting different pieces of the puzzle: anti-purinergics for chronic tuberculosis, sublingual vaccines for chronic hepatitis, transcranial ultrasound for chronic neuroglia and P2X7-mediated arrhythmia, rapamycin for sepsis or chronic HIV, glutamine inhibitors for chronic tuberculosis, genetic IRG1 inhibition to cure chronic plasmodium infections in mice, etc., etc. 

So this has been done. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that what I am proposing is just theory—it has worked in simpler models. For us, it will simply require a much broader and holistic approach, along with a wise way to track progress and a lot of patience, because this will take time.

So please, do not lose hope. Objectively, there are already tools we can implement that can work. But we need to be smart, put the right plan together, and follow it through.

...

If you had asked me this question two years ago, I would have said without a doubt that the purinergic receptor pathway is the most important. But both my partner and I spent a year and a half taking purinergic antagonists and, although the immune system improved significantly and we even tested negative for Lyme, we saw no significant clinical improvement. Similarly, mTOR sits at the center of everything, as multiple pathways converge on mTOR, and it is the main driver of mitochondrial dysfunction. The problem is that the reaction it produces is highly pro-inflammatory and very difficult to tolerate, and on its own it rarely cures, except in some rare cases. The ISR would also appear central, yet while stimulating it helps some patients, it is not a universal solution. The best results I have seen, by far, come from GcMAF, which improves roughly 70% of ME/CFS patients by about 50–70%—a remarkably high response rate. So this pathway appears to be truly fundamental. However When I reached a 70% functionality with GcMAF I was not fully recovered, so something was missing... 

On paper, AHR looks essential and one of the main immunosuppressive mechanisms. In Long COVID, when you inhibit it, PBMCs come out of immune exhaustion and mitochondrial function is restored perfectly, but we have no idea how this will behave in vivo.

We can also infer that endorphin deficiency is very important, based on the clinical benefits of LDN and ODSMT/tianeptin in many patients. But we still do not know what might happen when endorphins are stimulated at the correct magnitude, multiplied by up to 300,000-fold, as with MENK.

The truth is, we don’t know. But what is clear is that we enter the illness with many pathways all moving in the same maladaptive direction, and it is likely that we will need to activate multiple pathways simultaneously to reverse that trajectory. That is why I am convinced we will ultimately need a multi-pathway approach.

...

Your last question is the million-dollar question. In vivo, monotherapies work very well in mice, where there are no confounding factors. For example, purinergic antagonists cure chronic tuberculosis, glutamine metabolism inhibitors also cure chronic tuberculosis, purinergic antagonists also cure chronic tuberculosis and, if I recall correctly, even HIV and sepsis. mTOR inhibitors cure sepsis and all kinds of infections as well. The problem is that in humans we are far more complex: we are older, have accumulated more toxic exposures, carry many chronic infections, and have far more complicating factors that make clearing these infections much harder. Monotherapies do work in some anecdotal cases that we are all familiar with, but not in the majority.

...

Furthermore, I tend to believe it is much more effective to address 10 very important targets simultaneously at low doses, than to focus on one alone with great intensity, since the body works synergistically through multiple pathways that feedback into one another. In my opinion, adding therapies that make sense and reverse the pathophysiology of the CDR that led you into immunosuppression essentially improves the state, and importantly, the self-regulation of the immune system.

## PEM cause

You ask very pertinent questions, and I will try to answer with my opinion, although evidently none of us has the definitive answer or we wouldn’t be here.

To begin with, what causes PEM? In my opinion, when one exerts beyond limits and oxidative phosphorylation cannot meet the energy demand, what happens is an increase in ATP synthesis through anaerobic pathways in the cytoplasm. In that context, as lactate is generated from pyruvate, more NADH is produced, which raises the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio and worsens mitochondrial reductive stress. This excess reducing power promotes reverse electron transport (RET) in the respiratory chain, causing electrons to flow backwards and react with molecular oxygen, generating free radicals. Thus, both alterations combine: on the one hand oxidative stress, and on the other reductive stress, which feed into each other and further inactivate the mitochondria.

As a consequence, more danger signals are released —such as extracellular ATP, mitochondrial DNA, etc.— which hyperactivate the immune system. This explains why PEM lasts 3 or 4 days, characterized by increased inflammation and, in general terms, the entry of immune and non-immune somatic cells into CDR1 —as Naviaux has published. Altogether this leads to a global worsening, since inflammatory molecules reach the vagus nerve, transmit the signal to the brain, and the brain generates the sensation of fatigue, in addition to sending inhibitory signals to the mitochondria and the periphery, reinforcing that state during those days.

As for what directly causes the symptoms of the illness, we can extrapolate from animal models: What happens when you inject ATP into a mouse? The energetic efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation automatically drops by more than 70%. Therefore, we know that extracellular ATP, or any alarmin that activates the CDR, will induce fatigue. This energy failure translates into a wide range of anomalies: brain fog, digestive problems, disruption of the gastrointestinal and blood–brain barriers, orthostatic hypotension due to lack of energy to maintain blood pressure, as well as immune failure that allows the proliferation of previously controlled infections, among many others.

This same state can also be induced with TGF-β1, with LPS, with TNFα, with PGE2, with IFNα (in fact you can really cause CFS with this one), with acute or chronic infections, with toxins such as heavy metals or pesticides, with radiation, or even with overtraining. In all cases the result converges on the same: a generalized CDR state with a marked decrease in mitochondrial efficiency and immunosuppression, with chronic low-level inflammation. 

The central part of the nervous system implicated in the symptoms is mainly the limbic system. In it, structures such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate cortex and also the nucleus accumbens react to excess inflammation. This activation triggers what is called sickness behavior, which constitutes an essential part of why we feel ill, beyond the peripheral mitochondrial failure at the tissue level.

As to which of the mechanisms has greater importance, it is difficult to know. As you know, there are people with a very autoimmune profile who respond very well to Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis or IVIgs, while others do not. This explains why some people can have remarkable remissions by targeting a single piece, as with rapamycin, itraconazole, cervical instability surgery, etc.

Therefore, it is not that within 24 hours the pathogenic or toxic load suddenly worsens. What happens is the triggering of an acute mitochondrial failure together with an entry into CDR1, characterized by increased inflammation that sends signals to the brain. The brain interprets the situation as greater risk and translates it into a more intense sensation of fatigue.

## Treatment attempts

As for opioids, μ-opioid agonists are the most effective symptomatically because they act at the central node where the perception of fatigue (limbic system), brain inflammation (microglia), vagal danger signaling, and peripheral immune modulation converge. They do not repair mitochondrial dysfunction, but they “silence” the alarm and the sickness behavior response, allowing the patient to feel better while the effect lasts.

In the same way, dopaminergic activation with amphetamines also decreases sickness behavior, transiently reducing fatigue and other symptoms, although without correcting the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. I suppose aripiprazole can be included here as well. But all this is merely symptomatic.

As for why CNS depressants work in certain patients with sensory hyperactivation, the explanation is simple: they regulate the GABA/glutamate balance. In this way symptoms are reduced, although without addressing the root of the problem.

The problem with testing different drugs that might show some benefits is that most do not target the origin of the disease and therefore will never cure it. In fact, many therapies that truly work causally tend to worsen symptoms at first, because escaping immunosuppression implies going through an initial immune activation that is very unpleasant and aggravates symptoms. Therefore, it is important to investigate therapies that help patients, but always filtering which are merely symptomatic—which are also valuable!!! —and which have the potential to go to the root of the problem, which in my opinion is essentially immunological.

In reality, if you think about it, we should have considered μ-receptor activators a long time ago. Since it became known that LDN is possibly what works best in population terms in CFS and fibromyalgia, we should have deduced that, by increasing beta-endorphins and MENK, neuroglial activation is reduced (something that in fact has been demonstrated), and the immune system is activated through μ, δ and OGFr receptors. Actually we do have low methione levels probably because of the methylation issues (part of the CDR), so it makes sense that we cannot synthesize 5-methionine-enkephalin (MENK). This is something that could have been discovered earlier.

Of course, I am not ruling out that we may find new pathways. One example is the link between kynurenine and the AHR, and how this contributes to immunosuppression by increasing TGF-β and in turn activating the Janus kinase pathway, IL-6, etc.—a mechanism known only relatively recently. Another similar case is itaconate: until a few years ago it was considered an irrelevant metabolite, and the studies identifying it as a key immunometabolic regulator are only 4 or 5 years old.

In other words, new pathways continue to emerge, and we must always be vigilant to discover important mechanisms involved in both the CDR and immunosuppression.

In all cases, in AD there is usually an underlying mitochondrial failure that can be addressed with holistic therapies: deep ketosis, infrared and red LED light, transcranial ultrasound, reducing fermentable gut content (which produces toxins that can reach the brain via the vagus nerve), eliminating lectin-containing foods, heavy metal detoxification, and elimination of mold—both of which have been found in all Alzheimer’s brains STUDIED. The results of these strategies are truly remarkable.

Oh! And Borrelia burgdorferi has benn shown in virtually all AD brains... So no drug for reducing beta amyloid or TAU is going to work... 

Therefore, in the same way, in CFS/ME a holistic plan is required that goes to the root, and not simply trying hundreds of different drugs that in most cases will achieve nothing.


## Herpes testing

It is very useful to have both lytic and latent antigens. It might tell you whether you could benefit or not from traditional antivirals

---

Pretty interesting as oral testing was apparently (according to lab professor) introduced by NASA to test more accuarately and it seems to be the gold standard now for studies that examime EBV (for example the one I participated in 2021)

However I think certain viruses are almost impossible to catch reactivation of CMV, HHV6-8, VZV (unless outer signs) - and these need a combined approach with Titers and iga + igm testing.
Same with ParvovirusB19 which is one of the most frequent non Herpes ME/CFS viruses.

In my case the 60% of EBV was never replicated at least in my own samples.
And very interesting that HHV6 was never positive ever for me in blood and saliva testing despite immense titers. 17.1% Chance in healthy should have given me some bonus ahead lol.
So yeah in my special case, luckily the PCR testing seems to match the actual happenings.
Its quite easy to tell now for me personally when certain symptoms arrive - doing PCR testing and being positive.

It might also depend on the quality of the kits , cut off limit (very important!) etc, not sure how much has changed here quality wise.


## Methylene blue

Hydrogen peroxide is far less reactive than superoxide, so shifting the balance toward H₂O₂ can actually protect cells. Methylene blue accepts the surplus electrons that normally leak from complexes I, II and III and transfers them directly to molecular oxygen, forming H₂O₂ instead of letting those electrons create superoxide. Less superoxide means less peroxynitrite, because superoxide must combine with nitric oxide to generate that highly destructive species. The small rise in H₂O₂ that follows is quickly neutralised by glutathione peroxidase and related enzymes, so the net effect is a cleaner redox environment, not added oxidative stress.

When we look at the whole picture—where mitochondrial membrane potential recovers, ATP output rises and oxidative markers fall—the data consistently show improvement, even in the high-dose in-vitro experiments where H₂O₂ goes up. Those conditions exaggerate exposure far beyond what anyone would use therapeutically, yet they still do not report mitochondrial damage or an overall pro-oxidant shift. Context therefore matters: methylene blue at sensible doses reduces the most harmful radicals and supports mitochondrial function rather than impairing it.

The hormetic effect of methylene blue is not the classic type—where, for example, you administer an oxidant that activates NRF2 and boosts glutathione levels. In this context, I agree with you that it’s useless for CFS. 

Here, the idea is that methylene blue is hormetic because at low doses it reduces excessive oxidative stress, while at high doses it acts as a pro-oxidant. In other words, low doses are beneficial and high doses are harmful. Still, the nature of this effect differs greatly from the typical hormetic response usually cited for many other substances.

It won't create H2O2 at low doses. Actually it should reduce it. Even at medium-high doses H2O2 might increse but the total redox status is improved. It is only at very high doses that MB is pro-oxidant, which could help in certain acute infections.


This is a high dose of 10 mg per kg in a murine trial that effectively increased the NAD⁺/NADH ratio, improving mitochondrial function. However, I believe this is a high dose, and there is evidence that between 25 and 70 mg per day for a 70 kg person should also work, since in the same study, for example, doses of 3 mg per kg were also effective, though not as much. Therefore, I understand that up to 70–80 mg per day, if tolerated, could be safe but I'd start at 20 mg/day and increase slowly. 

Regarding the microbiome, mouse studies support that it improves up to human-equivalent doses of approximately 1.2 mg per kg, while very high doses around 4 mg per kg lead to a worsening of the microbiome. At the doses we’re discussing, methylene blue appears to enhance microbiome balance and increase biodiversity.

Let me clarify. There is a study with rats where doses of 10 and 3 mg/kg were successful in increasing the NAD+/NADH  ratio, and in improving all mitochondrial measurements.

This translates into human equivalent doses of  0.48 and 1.6 mg/kg.

## Mitophagy vs danger signals

I agree with O3 — you need fission to initiate mitophagy, and later on, mitochondrial biogenesis is activated to restore mitochondrial mass.

However, these processes are downstream and should be orchestrated by the mitochondria themselves once they perceive a safe and permissive environment.

That’s why, in my opinion, the priority is to reduce danger signals.

I understand that some people may feel better by stimulating mitophagy, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, or inhibiting DRP1. But in severe, long-term ME/CFS patients, we are likely in a state of deep exhaustion where mitochondria remain predominantly fused. In such a context, stimulating mitophagy might simply not be feasible, even if artificially induced — and promoting biogenesis may backfire by increasing ROS and oxidative stress.

Indeed, as long as mTOR remains elevated, the process will be unproductive. But again, mTOR is upregulated for a reason — primarily via purinergic receptor signaling,  through ER stress pathways (ATF6/Rheb), increased ROS and NO, TLRs, or directly in response to mitochondrial damage.

In chronic settings such as immunosuppression, low-grade inflammation, or cellular senescence, mTOR activity remains persistently high. Elevated mTORC1 suppresses mitophagy by phosphorylating ULK1/ATG13, thereby blocking autophagosome initiation, and by retaining TFEB in the cytosol, which limits lysosome biogenesis. Although local PINK1-Parkin signalling can still tag damaged mitochondria, the incomplete autophagic flux leads to poor clearance.

 Rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors restore mitophagy under these conditions, which proves the link between mTOR and mitophagy


## Ultrasound therapy

Some time ago, a colleague asked me the exact same question, and this was the summary I shared with him about how I came to the conclusion that transcranial ultrasound might be a useful tool. I honestly don’t know whether to expect a strong therapeutic effect—but I do know that the idea makes conceptual sense.

One key insight is that different forms of “memory” can trap the body in a chronic pathological state. One of them is clearly immunological. Another lies in the physical structure and electrochemical state of cell membranes. But there's also a third—and often overlooked—form: neurological memory.

A powerful illustration of this is phantom limb pain, where a person continues to feel pain in a limb that no longer exists. The pain isn’t coming from the body, but from persisting activity in brain circuits that no longer reflect reality. The nervous system, in effect, remembers the illness or injury, and replays it.

Even more compelling are recent animal studies showing that if you induce a physical illness in a mouse—for example, an intestinal infection—and record the specific neural circuits that become active during that disease, you can later artificially reactivate those same circuits in a healthy mouse, and it will begin to display the same physical symptoms, even though there is no ongoing infection or pathology. This shows that certain patterns of neural activity are sufficient to recreate disease states, even when the original cause is gone.

here is how I came to the conclusion that it could work:

I was studying the effects of pulsed ultrasound on the spleen to boost the immune system, and I came across a study that really caught my attention. In this study, applying ultrasound to the hypothalamus reversed a ventricular arrhythmia, which I found quite fascinating. That led me to start exploring transcranial ultrasound.I recalled studies on CT38, where it’s explained that elevated levels of urocortins, or in this case CRFR2, which would be chronically activated along with chronically elevated serotonin levels, could perpetuate a chronic dysfunctional and inflammatory state in the hypothalamus and amygdala. 

This made me wonder if there could be a link between ultrasound and conditioned fear. Indeed, I found another study, which I’m attaching, that shows focused transcranial ultrasound targeting the hypothalamus can reduce conditioned fear responses in mice. So, I began looking for more information and found that while most research is focused on ultrasound targeting the hypothalamus, there are a couple of studies in Alzheimer’s disease where transcranial ultrasound was applied to the entire skull, showing good results. 

Based on this and numerous studies on transcranial ultrasound for conditions like depression, anxiety, and various central nervous system disorders, I decided to commission the construction of an ultrasound device with the required specifications, making sure the power level is appropriate to avoid to fry my brain...

In addition to all this, I had read a study some time ago where they found, for the first time, the neurological switches of inflammation in the nuclei of the solitary tract in the brainstem. In this study, inflammation caused by LPS disappeared when these nuclei were chemically inhibited. Later, I discovered a study where ultrasound, in this case applied to the brainstem, managed to reduce inflammation caused by hypertension in mice, which I’m also attaching. 

Therefore, my goal is to test ultrasound not only on the hypothalamus and amygdala but also on the brainstem....

I agree! That's why I am going to try the transcraneal ultrasound, because it could promote a similar un-blocking effect without the risks of the CT38


## Hypometabolism markers

Hypometabolism is shown in many blood/urine markers such as low blood lactate, low temperature,  low urine aspartate, high urine succinate/fumarate ratio, high TSH, or exhausted immunity including high PGE2, high TGF-beta1, low NK lytic activity, low mRNA perforins, low CD3-CD57+, low IL-12, low IFN gamma, high IL-10, high IL-5, low total IgGs, etc.

Even low uric acid could indicate hypometabolism. Or low blood aminoacids, with low/normal acute phase reactants inflammatory markers such as HS-CRP, ESR, ferritin or fibrinogen...


Baking soda test
There’s a supposed home test, you could look it up. In a nutshell, add some baking soda to a glass of water and down it. If you burp within a couple minutes, you have adequate stomach acid. If you don’t, then starting with a tiny bit, take some apple cider vinegar/ water  and see if it’s tolerated. But in my case, I don’t burp but the vinegar  will fry me. Y M M V...


## CDR overview

To answer this question, we first need to define what CDR is. CDR is not a theory, nor is it something random. It is a classification of states that all cells in the body enter when facing stress more severe than usual. It consists of three states that always occur in the same order. First, CDR1, characterized by inflammation and a significant reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, which is linked to innate immunity in immune cells. Then, CDR2, which is based on proliferation, where mitochondrial function begins to improve. Finally, CDR3, where mitochondrial function is nearly normal, metabolic functions are almost restored, but there is still the need to reconnect with other cells and the central nervous system.

In this regard, all diseases have a higher proportion of one of these three states. In acute infections, there will logically be a predominance of inflammatory CDR1, while diseases such as cancer, fibrotic diseases, or diabetes will be dominated by CDR2. In autoimmune diseases, CDR3A is typically predominant, whereas fatigue-related conditions fall under a subtype called CDR3B, which is characterized by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, glycolysis impairment, high NADH, low lactate, and other metabolic disturbances unique to this CDR3B state.

Therefore, CDR is neither a theory nor something that applies solely to ME/CFS. It consists of measurable, universal states in which all diseases can be categorized, although there will always be cells in each of the three states.

What determines which state we are in or what disease we end up with? It is evidently a matter of the initial insult itself. For example, if you get infected with COVID, you will have CDR1. If you contract a chronic infection, you may enter CDR1 and sometime CDR3B (like CFS) . If you develop diabetes, CDR2 will predominate. Thus, the cause is highly important. 

Another crucial factor is your HLA type—how well your antigen-presenting cells can present antigens. If you are unlucky and get exposed to mold or Epstein-Barr virus while carrying HLA-DR15 (I believe this is the one) or other less efficient HLA types, your MHC class II molecules will struggle with antigen presentation, leading to immune exhaustion. Therefore, genetic factors in antigen recognition and presentation are fundamental.

Additionally, the location of infections plays a key role. Depending on whether infections are present in the vagus nerve, immune cells, or specific regions of the brain, you will develop different diseases. If CDR occurs in cells of the brain’s substantia nigra, for example, you will develop Parkinson’s.

There is also the issue of antigenic stimulation. Autoimmune diseases often originate in the gut due to intestinal permeability, where bacterial and dietary antigens come into contact with the immune system or, through molecular mimicry, trigger autoimmunity since these antigens do not induce immune tolerance. As a result, autoimmune symptoms develop. However, if the issue is bacteria that stimulate the immune system through LPS, or if there is bacterial translocation with high levels of LPS, these will actually induce immune tolerance. Similarly, herpesviruses are known to develop strategies that promote immune tolerance. This means that the infectious agent itself will shape the symptomatology in one direction or another depending on the nature of the antigenic stimulus.


And finally, there is another very interesting evolutionary aspect. For example, people who tend to develop obesity do not actually have a problem in a fundamental sense. In the past, they would have been the ones most likely to survive during periods of famine. Similarly, it is possible that those of us who have developed ME/CFS actually have a much greater ability to contain viruses at the unicellular level compared to others. In the past, this might have given us a significant advantage in facing epidemics, whereas today, with the overwhelming toxic and pathogenic burden, it may simply be too much, leading us to illness.

Lastly, genetic variability, or heterogenetic variability, likely predisposes individuals to different diseases—that is, to different CDR states—depending on the interaction of thousands of genes, which we are currently completely incapable of fully understanding.

## What is CDR? 

We need to define the Cell Danger Response (CDR) properly. CDR refers to all the known and described mechanisms that a cell activates whenever it encounters any stressor that pushes it out of its homeostatic state. Therefore, it is not a “possible component” that may or may not exist or be relevant to disease. Rather, it is simply the collective name for all the mechanisms that are switched on under stress. In other words, whenever there is disease, there is CDR.

I take as a starting point that ME/CFS is initially triggered by stressors—mainly infections and toxins. The order doesn’t matter, since both immunosuppress you, generate oxidative stress, and drive cells into a CDR state. One leads to the other and viceversa. 

Infections, for their part—all of them—when they become chronic, activate the same immunosuppressive mechanisms to prevent clearance. These mechanisms are well known and well described. This is why you can theorize, and indeed observe in studies, that by altering or reversing these mechanisms you can exit the state of immunosuppression and overcome the infection.

When cells are infected or exposed to any other type of stress—be it toxins, mycotoxins, radiation (ionizing or non-ionizing), oxidative stress, or even physical or psychological stress—the mechanisms that are activated are also known and fall under CDR. This means we can identify the main biochemical targets that need to be addressed.

This is especially evident in immune cells: repeated exposure to LPS, for example, drives them into exhaustion, and you can study in detail all the physiological changes that occur to confirm these mechanisms. But the same can be reproduced in uninfected cells by exposing them to free radicals, cytokines, radiation, or DNA mutations, which trigger the same pathways, though in this case generating senescent cells. These mechanisms are also well described. 

Therefore, it is not as random as it might seem: by looking at how a cell becomes exhausted and progresses through the three stages of CDR, and which metabolic pathways are altered, you realize that the number of possible outcomes is finite and they are always the same.

From here, we can broaden or narrow the perspective. At the cellular level, we find the same well-described alterations corresponding to CDR1 and/or to CDR3A/hypometabolism. At the systemic level, the immune system becomes central, since its state is what matters most, and its profile is well understood and measurable. 

The connection with the central nervous system during CDR is also known: sympathetic activity increases, parasympathetic activity decreases, and so on. From this, we can deduce the likely CNS state, and in this way we can go step by step from the cell to the whole organism, describing all the systemic abnormalities that Naviaux documented in his writings, including hormones, metabolome, microbiome, etc. Everything is connected and stems from the same chronic un-resolved cellular stress, affecting different tissues.

## CDR and reductive stress

If you look at the Naviaux paper describing what cells do under CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, the transition we observe—from an inflammatory state with high NK cell activity and a Th1/Th17 response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial fission, elevated antioxidant response, and even high NAD+ levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, or lactate levels, to a state with reduced inflammation, low NK activity, a predominant Th2 response, reductive stress, low lactate, low GSH, low NAD+, and mitochondrial hyperfusion—clearly reflects a progression from a CDR1-like state to a more CDR3a-like state.

It’s essentially the same pattern that occurs when CD8+ T cells, NK cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells are repeatedly stimulated with LPS; they undergo the same type of transition.



Sorry [x] , I think I missed replying to your message? , and if I did reply, I will update it now. I have been trying to research and compare the causes of reductive stress between obesity and immune cell exhaustion to understand where ME/CFS would fit better.

In obesity, the main driver of reductive stress is a very high electron flow through glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, primarily caused by insulin via the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which leads to the induction of enzymes consuming NAD+ such as PPARs, as well as the synthesis of IDO, which converts tryptophan into kynurenine, thereby further activating AHR. Additionally, enzymes like CD38 are also induced, further depleting NAD⁺ levels.

The excess electron flow leads to over-reduction of coenzyme Q (CoQ), causing electron leakage from Complexes I, II, and III, reducing oxygen to superoxide (O₂⁻), which in turn reacts with nitric oxide (NO) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻). Both NO and ONOO⁻ inhibit mitochondrial complexes. Moreover, ONOO⁻ also increases PPAR expression, further depleting NAD⁺.

In obesity, there is also a characteristic pattern where the high electron flux from fatty acid oxidation leads to elevated acetyl-CoA levels, causing hyperacetylation of mitochondrial complexes, including NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase), which further inhibits NADH oxidation.

In ME/CFS, the mechanisms are similar, as there are elevated levels of IDO2, activation of AHR, high kynurenine levels, and clear signs of reductive stress, along with high levels of peroxynitrite and possibly increased nitrosative reactions involving NO and peroxynitrite. However, as occurs in exhausted immune cells, sustained high levels of IFN-α lead to PD-1 activation. PD-1 is a major inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Initially, in cells beginning to exhaust, glycolysis decreases while FAO increases. A similar pattern is observed in ME/CFS: early stages show increased FAO, but as the disease progresses, FAO declines, leading to decreased acetyl-CoA production, just like in severely exhausted cells.

This decrease in acetyl-CoA is critical because it impairs the expression of pro-inflammatory genes like IL-6 and IL-1β, preventing immune cells from performing their functions properly, in addition to maintaining mitochondrial inhibition.

Another key mechanism behind reductive stress in ME/CFS is the elevated flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), since glycolytic flux, particularly at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), is inhibited. This leads to decreased bioavailability of BH₄ (tetrahydrobiopterin), resulting in uncoupling of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increased superoxide production, and worsening of the overall redox imbalance.

All of these processes are downstream events secondary to the activation of purinergic receptors, mTOR, or IFN-α signaling.

For instance, the initial stimulus driving high electron flux through glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in activated immune cells is mTOR, which is itself activated by purinergic receptors. Moreover, both purinergic receptors and mTOR stimulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to itaconate production and PD-1 upregulation, contributing to reductive stress and, ultimately, mitochondrial dysfunction.

Therefore, and sorry for the long answer to your question, while reductive stress is indeed a key mechanism underlying mitochondrial failure at the biochemical level, I am uncertain whether addressing such a downstream point would be sufficient to reverse the upstream signaling that maintains the chronic CDR state.

Nevertheless, mechanistically, I find this drug very promising because it seems to act as a redox cycling agent: it reduces itself to oxidize NADH into NAD⁺ and then reoxidizes, repeating this cycle continuously until it is eventually eliminated from the body. I think this is a very smart mechanism that could be highly effective.

However, in a context of persistent chronic infections, chronic inflammation, continuous TLRs and PRRs activation, and ongoing IFN-α and purinergic signaling, I am unsure whether simply increasing the NAD⁺/NADH ratio would be enough to reverse the overall process. I am genuinely eager to see whether it can. Therefore, I strongly encourage you guys to test it, and to do so for a sufficiently long period to allow clear effects to manifest.

For example, in obesity, therapies targeting NAD⁺ restoration are effective in reducing insulin resistance, oxidative excess, and AHR overactivation, among other improvements.




Sure, NRF2 would contribute to more reductive stress.

The reductive stress at the mitochondrial level will cause electron leakage which will reduce 02 forming superoxide that will be converted into H2O2 or peroxinitrite, highly reactive.

So essentially, the reductive stress at the mitochondrial membrane (and also in the cytosol as seen by high NADH and NADPH) will create ROS and RNS that explain the oxidative and Nitrosative damage observed in ME/CFS.

This explains why many studies does not find low GSH levels but instead normal or even higher levels


The problem is that we have a high NADH/NAD⁺ ratio.
If we take NAD⁺, it will accept an electron from glucose oxidation and become NADH, but then it will remain stuck in that reduced state, unable to transfer the electron to the mitochondrial electron transport chain to regenerate ATP.

Instead, it will over-reduce CoQ that will send the electrons backwards and will leak and react with excess and unused oxygen to form superoxide (what is called reverses electron transport), worsening the whole picture. 

The issue isn’t NAD⁺ itself. What we need is for the mitochondria to initiate oxidative phosphorylation properly—begin transferring electrons efficiently, establish the correct proton gradient, and then reduce oxygen to eventually phosphorylate ADP into ATP.

This is fundamentally a mitochondrial signaling problem.


Yeah, I think they got it backwards. When there is immune-suppression, tryptophan/kynurenine ratio DECREASES, as seen in the study of long covid patients and Inhibiting EITHER AHR OR TDO2 reverts this, breaking the immune-suppressive vicious cycle:
 inflammation/IDO/kynurenine/AhR/TGF-Β1/IL6/JNK1/STAT3/kynurenine...

I really like TDO2 as a target, but unfortunately I didn't find any suitable compound for our hamsters1




**I had another long talk with Ron Davis 2 days ago, here are some of my notes (they may not be perfect, I couldn't catch everything):**

Last week, Ron Davis, Rob Phair, and Laurel Crosby were talking, and they think they have a good idea about what is going on in PEM specifically. 

ROS oxidizes BH4 to BH2, and now you can't dilate blood vessels because you need BH4 to do this, and BH4 is also needed for other critical things like dopamine synthesis, ...

This decrease in BH4 could be delayed because it could a while for the oxidation to happen, which could explain why PEM is often delayed. 

And it gets oxidated into nitrate. There are old publications about how heavy exercise leads to high nitrate levels.

So essentially, for PEM at least, Ron and those think decreasing ROS could be the most important target to address PEM.



This would help but it is a downstream bandaid. It all comes down to too much NADH and too low NAD+, caused by many factors, such as too much food in obesity,  infections in ME/CFS directly by activating PARP-1 or indirectly by continuously stimulating the immune system causing too much electrons going backwards and generating ROS, or inflammation stimulating IDO/kynurenine/AHR that will consume NAD+ by activating more IDO, CD38, PARP-1 etc. 

This reductive stress at the mitochondria creates NO, peroxinitrite, itaconate, excess acetylation... That will inhibit mitochondrial complexes.

Too much NADH will generate too much NADPH. Also, the glycolytic flux is impared, and the flux through the Pentose Phosphate pathway is increased, creating more NADPH, contributing to higher reductive stress and further oxidative stress as a consequence. 

Inhibiting AHR is an efficient way to stop this cycle IMO. Also, inhibiting the PPP (with RRX001) seems like a good idea to me.

Anything that oxidizes NADH into NAD+ will help revert this process. And booting the immune system lowering the microbial burden in the first place seems paramount.

With that said, I'll research those molecules in case you can help revert the reductive stress by impeding the electron leakage...  It would be great if they would increase NAD+/NADH!



According to Ron Davis and other researchers, measuring BH4 is very difficult because it degrades rapidly, like in 1h!

Regarding the levels found in ME/CFS, exactly: one team has reported elevated BH4 levels, while Ron Davis’s group appears to have found them low. But in any case, it doesn’t really matter. The key point is that in the study where both BH4 and BH2 were found to be very high due to an increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, the authors explain that the result of reductive stress is the leakage of electrons from the early mitochondrial complexes. These electrons then generate superoxide, which reacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite. This, in turn, reacts with BH4 to produce BH3 and BH2. The excess BH2 competes with BH4 at the iNOS enzyme, preventing its proper coupling, which requires BH4. As a result, iNOS becomes uncoupled and produces even more superoxide, perpetuating the cycle.

Furthermore, oxidative overload lowers the SAMe-to-SAH ratio, decreasing the formation of 5-MTHF, which further impairs iNOS coupling. Therefore, whether actual BH4 levels are high or low is not so important. What truly matters is that iNOS becomes uncoupled, producing excessive ROS and RNS, and this—together with the mitochondrial reductive stress that causes electrons to leak from complexes I, II, and III, forming superoxide that reacts with nitric oxide—perpetuates the vicious cycle. This leads to inefficient iNOS, low or poorly bioavailable BH4, and all the associated consequences, such as low levels of catecholamines, serotonin, endogenous opioids, and so on.




It won't be a cure or else we all would know! But I like the combo of ALA, MB, TMS and RRX-001 to directly address the reductive stress that, in the end is probably where all the mitochondrial shutdown starts...




A central issue in sepsis-induced immunosuppression is cellular energy depletion and lymphocyte death caused by ROS overload and massive PARP-1 activation. As a PARP inhibitor, BGP-15 preserves intracellular NAD⁺ levels, preventing the catastrophic drop in ATP that leads to cell death under severe inflammation. Additionally, by intercalating into and stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, BGP-15 reduces excessive free radical production from the respiratory chain, limiting oxidative danger signals that would otherwise trigger pro-apoptotic pathways and NF-κB. Indeed, BGP-15 has been shown to decrease ROS generation at mitochondrial complexes I and III, protecting cells from oxidative damage and necrosis. This oxidative stress reduction impacts key immune signaling pathways: it limits overactivation of inflammatory MAPKs (JNK, p38) and transcription factors like NF-κB and AP-1, while positively modulating cytoprotective regulators such as NRF2. Functionally, these actions may result in reduced harmful cytokine production and improved immune cell survival during sepsis or other chronic inflammation scenarios.


Some viral infections take advantage of the stimulation of pathways that lead to antioxidant synthesis for their survival. To achieve this, they sometimes activate the pentose phosphate pathway, or they stimulate the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) to induce chaperone production and activate NRF2, thereby promoting the synthesis of antioxidants and chaperones to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress, which could otherwise kill them.

Similarly, some infections stimulate apoptosis in order to reproduce and spread the infection to other cells, while others inhibit apoptosis and promote autophagy to replicate within the host cell. Therefore, in vitro studies using certain infections cannot be directly extrapolated to a much more complex in vivo system, where infections are confined to specific cell types and the immune system plays a central role in eliminating these infected cells regardless of what a drug might do to an isolated cell.

A very clear example is rapamycin, which is a strong immune stimulator. At the single-cell level, it inhibits replication of some infections while enhancing others. But systemically, it consistently stimulates the immune system — and that is what matters most.

In this sense, stimulating the chaperone Hsp70 is generally immunostimulatory, as it activates cellular repair mechanisms and inhibits processes that suppress oxidative phosphorylation. This leads to improved mitochondrial function and, from an immunological perspective, better overall immune cell performance, helping them to recover from immune exhaustion.



(In response to the question M asked me on Mattermost, I'm replying here for greater visibility and because this is the most appropriate place to do so). 


*** M's question:

*"Conversely, when NF-κB is activated by inflammatory stimuli, it can inhibit AhR by interfering with its dimerization with ARNT, thereby limiting AhR-driven gene expression. This mutual inhibition establishes a regulatory balance between immune responses and xenobiotic signaling. However, when AhR activation dominates, such as in response to dioxin exposure, the suppression of NF-κB contributes to immunosuppression, reducing inflammation independently of direct effects on immune cells."*

What could this mean for the Bezisterim (Orally active partial NF-κB inhibitor) trial in conjunction with TMS or without TMS?
I think many people have purchased both molecules.


*** My answer:

That’s a very good question, so I’m going to answer it with as much detail as I can to explain the reasoning behind my position. That said, I really hope I’m wrong and that the therapy proves to be effective. I’ll be following your experience with NF-κB pathway inhibition with great interest!! 

In ME/CFS, as you know, the early phase of the illness is typically characterized by a predominantly pro-inflammatory immune profile. Most immune cells display a CDR1-like state, marked by high activation of NF-κB and the inflammasome, which results in a strong Th1/Th17 cytokine response. During this phase, inflammatory mediators such as interferon-α, interferon-γ, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-8 are often elevated.

However, as the disease progresses—and especially in patients with longer duration and more severe phenotypes—there is a transition toward a state of immune exhaustion, more consistent with a CDR3a signature, as described by Naviaux. In this phase, key cytotoxic cell types like CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells, which are crucial for antiviral and antitumor defense, show reduced expression of canonical NF-κB, reflecting their exhausted functional state.

Interestingly, the myeloid lineage, including monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, does not show full suppression of NF-κB. Rather, they appear to undergo a functional rewiring. Although the classical pro-inflammatory NF-κB outputs—such as IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-12—are largely downregulated, monocytes maintain a modified NF-κB signaling profile, often involving non-canonical dimers like RelB/p52 or p50:p50, which continue to drive the production of chemokines such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), and in some cases CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL9 (MIG), and CCL2 (MCP-1), despite the suppression of classical high-energy pro-inflammatory cytokines

Given that macrophages and dendritic cells are more directly exposed to persistent stimulation by TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors, they remain in a state of chronic low-grade activation, secreting chemokines that contribute to ongoing inflammation. However, the lack of corresponding Th1-driving cytokines means that the CD8⁺ and NK compartments do not receive adequate activation signals, thus perpetuating immune dysfunction.

It’s also important to consider that myeloid cells secrete far more cytokines per cell than lymphocytes. Therefore, in some patients and in published studies, we may observe elevated plasma levels of IL-8 or CXCL10, which could be misinterpreted as reflecting strong immune activation. In reality, these levels may simply reflect baseline chemokine leakage from tolerised or semi-activated monocytes, rather than genuine inflammatory escalation.

Regarding the interaction between AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) and NF-κB, it makes mechanistic sense that they are mutually antagonistic—one promoting anti-inflammatory tolerance and the other driving inflammatory gene programs. When AHR activity predominates, as may be the case in ME/CFS, it correlates with suppression of NF-κB, which may partially explain the immune system’s failure to mount appropriate responses.

As for the idea of directly inhibiting NF-κB, I agree it could make sense in early-stage disease, when the immune system is in a hyper-inflammatory, CDR1-type state. In this phase, excessive NF-κB activation may in fact contribute to the later collapse of immune function. Therefore, perhaps pulsed NF-κB inhibition might help mitigate that inflammatory burden and prevent future exhaustion.

However, in chronic, advanced ME/CFS with clear immunological exhaustion, I believe that NF-κB inhibition may be counterproductive. By further suppressing NF-κB, especially in already exhausted cytotoxic cells, we may risk exacerbating immunosuppression and further diminishing the host’s ability to respond to latent viral antigens or other immunological challenges.

That said, I do acknowledge that inhibiting NF-κB in myeloid cells might relieve some of the low-grade, chemokine-driven inflammation, and this could lead to short-term symptom improvement. Still, I’m concerned that this might not be durable, and that stopping the drug could result in a rebound of pathogenic systemic activity.

Of course, I sincerely hope I’m wrong. We’ve seen how some immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory interventions have led to  clinical improvement in ME/CFS. So these hypotheses remain theoretical, and as always in this field, reality often surprises us. Let’s hope this is one of those cases.



Sepsis begins with a highly inflammatory component in response to a systemic infection, where the immune system is in CDR1 with very high extracellular ATP levels, interferon-alpha, inflammatory cytokines, etc. This causes all these mechanisms, after a few days or several weeks, to rapidly shift into the immunosuppressive phase, since it is the same inflammatory mechanisms that ultimately drive the final immunosuppressive phase, characterized by immune system exhaustion. The parallel with CFS is clear, as the patterns are very similar in terms of exhausted immune cells, an inability to mount an immune response, very low levels of inflammatory cytokines, evident mitochondrial failure, reductive stress, etc. It is as if CFS were a form of sepsis but at a chronic level.

Exactly as I explained in my message, given that we are in a phase of immune exhaustion, it is much more difficult to mount an appropriate, acute response to viral or bacterial infections.

 As for neutrophils, their numbers may be normal or slightly elevated in some cases, but since neutrophils primarily reflect the innate response to an acute infection, they are not particularly relevant in our case. However, there are indeed indications that functionally they are also exhausted.



The CDR protects individual cells from viruses and bacteria and is very powerful in acute scenarios. However, when the infection becomes chronic, the CDR becomes counterproductive. If the affected cell is a tissue cell, it will no longer perform its normal functions and will instead secrete alarm signals, spreading the CDR activation to the rest of the body and the CNS.

If it is an immune cell, chronic CDR activation leads to immune exhaustion, making us unable to clear infections. There is a persistent, futile attempt at immune activation, resulting in never-ending, fruitless, mild inflammation that never fully resolves.

If a cold virus enters the body, we manage it with our existing immune resources in a semi-effective way—otherwise, we would be so immunosuppressed that we would not survive. However, we are unable to mount a fully efficient immune response like healthy individuals, so symptoms tend to be milder or even absent.

I do suspect, however, that because of this, we accumulate more and more infections over time. Indeed, in ME/CFS, large reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, herpesviruses, fungi, and many others have been documented.

When we push ourselves physically, due to inefficient OXPHOS at the mitochondria, we try to compensate by boosting glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but this fails, leading to electron leakage and a localized increase in ROS formation. This eventually triggers a peak of mTOR activation, IFN-α production, extracellular ATP release, etc., pushing us into a transient CDR1 state. This further depletes mitochondrial oxidative capacity for several days. In my opinion, this is what underlies PEM.

It is evident that the CDR has been found both in the periphery and in the CNS, and that each greatly influences the other. The periphery sends signals through the vagus nerve and through soluble alarmins crossing the BBB, while the CNS sends signals to the periphery through different efferent nerves.

However, remember that Suramin does not cross the BBB, yet it "cures" autism in mice and improves autism symptoms in autistic children. This is clear evidence that the periphery has a significant influence on the CNS.


## Is CDR universal?

Regarding your second question, it is not entirely accurate. Strictly speaking, the term CDR was coined by Naviaux, referring to all the cellular processes that are triggered when a cell is exposed to any kind of stressor—whether microbiological, oxidative, reductive, toxic, ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation, etc.

This includes absolutely all the mechanisms that have already been studied and are well established in the scientific literature, although they were often considered separately. These include, for example, the integrated stress response, the chaperone response, autophagy, mitophagy, the increase in free radicals, the decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and the initial rise in glycolysis, the unfolded protein response, apoptosis, and so on.

What Naviaux contributed was the realization that these processes always occur in a specific sequence, which he termed CDR1, then CDR2, and then CDR3. In other words, whenever cells enter this state due to stress, they will always begin with the first stage, and to exit the CDR they must progress through the same stages in order.

Naviaux argues that the main perpetuating mechanism of the CDR is extracellular ATP and/or the sensitization of purinergic receptors on the cell membrane, which overreact to nearly normal levels of extracellular ATP. But if you take the time to study all these processes carefully, there are docens of activated pathways that are potentially therapeutically modifiable, and personally I am trying to compile which of them are the most important beyond the purinergic pathway.

Moreover, Naviaux has realized that these states represent a universal process of all the body’s cells to try to overcome stress and achieve healing by returning to a state of cellular homeostasis.

It is very important to clarify that all the components and processes belonging to the CDR were already known and studied; they are not theoretical. Above all, the CDR always exists whenever there is a deviation from cellular homeostasis. In other words, wherever there is disease, there is CDR. Simply, in different diseases one or another CDR state predominates.

Another important point to clarify is that all cells enter the CDR if exposed to stress. However, I often refer specifically to the immune system because I believe it ultimately determines the state of disease. For example, macrophages, when activated, enter a CDR1 state—not necessarily just because there is a stressor, but because they are activated, and they harness all the machinery of CDR1 to fight infections. If the infection is not cleared and they remain activated for too long, they eventually move through the phases until they reach CDR3, where eventually they become exhausted.

This concept is difficult to grasp, but it is true. In other words, the same processes occur during the normal activation of the immune system as when any non-immune tissue cell in the body is exposed to different types of stress. This is very useful because by studying how a macrophage is activated, how it enters the state, and how it becomes exhausted, we can observe all the steps of the CDR and extrapolate them to all other cells.

All the cells of the body have been shown to enter CDR in response to any stressor—from the liver in hepatitis to glial cells in our disease and in any neurological disorder, or even in chronic infections such as HIV, as well as immune cells, endothelial cells, muscle cells, endocrine cells, etc. This is why the CDR involves the entire organism. 

In other words, the CDR is not an isolated theory—it is a unified designation of cellular processes that occur in the body under different stressors, the consequence of which is always disease. The symptoms will depend on which tissues are most affected and in which CDR stage those cells predominantly reside.

## CDR reading list

I'd start with this one first:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22700427/

And then read all the others, especially the one from 2014:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567724913002390

And the last one from 2023:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120082/

However, let me warn you about something. Keep in mind that Naviaux’s papers, especially the early ones, simply describe the CDR in a situation of acute stress. And even though he does cite CDR3, the diseases described there present a very pro-inflammatory profile, which is the complete opposite of what happens in our case. 

I believe it was starting with the ME/CFS paper that he noticed the metabolic parameters were reversed compared to what he had found in acute CDR. That is when he began to propose a hypometabolic type of CDR (CDR3A) which he only formally described in the most recent 2023 paper, where you can see it in the attached figure referred to as HSS (hypometabolic survival syndromes).

On the other hand, I should explain that unfortunately Naviaux does not focus on the immune system, but rather in cellular metabolism and mitochondria. That is why he focuses on metabolic pathways and says very little about the immune system. Nor does he go into describing known processes such as ISR, UPR, mitophagy, autophagy, etc. Instead, he mainly focuses on explaining the role of mitochondria in controlling, planning, and regulating all these metabolic processes, how the purinergic pathway is the main regulator of it all, and then elaborates on how the CDR is a repair mechanism orchestrated by the mitochondria, and so on.

However, the angle from which he describes it and the focus he gives it is also very useful. It all begins with a lack of electrons at the cytoplasmic level, which is sensed by the mitochondrion as an oxidative signal, triggering its shutdown. As a consequence, the oxygen that should have been consumed and reduced at mitochondrial complex IV instead generates free radicals, both through the activity of NADPH oxidase and by reacting with electrons leaking from the mitochondria. All of this sets in motion an intracellular oxidative defense mechanism, an ancestral response inherited from bacteria.

I spent a long time reflecting on what exactly he meant by “stealing electrons.” Of course, this refers to the fact that any stressor—whether free radicals, most toxins, or most infections—directly causes oxidative stress, which is what the mitochondrion actually senses. But this also includes the activation of all PRRs, since they likewise induce mechanisms that lead to oxidative stress. Similarly, when there is an infection and endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs, this is also perceived as a lack of electrons, or oxidative stress. In other words, it is a very simplified way of referring to a set of mechanisms that are in reality highly complex.

If you are looking for something related to the central nervous system and the CDR, the most direct work is the theoretical studies published by Naviaux on the relationship between autism and the CDR:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29253638/

Beyond that, if you want to read about the CDR in neurological diseases, you should look, for example, at UPR or ISR in Alzheimer’s, or explore the purinergic system in neuroglial activation, the purinergic system in Parkinson’s, or mTOR and mitochondria in the central nervous system, etc. In other words, you need to be creative and search for the parts of the CDR that interest you in the specific disease you want to study.

For example:
"Glial Purinergic Signaling-Mediated Oxidative Stress (GPOS) in Neuropsychiatric Disorders" 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35281471/

## Immunosuppressed/infected protocol

Hey M,

Based on the analysis I conducted for you, here is my opinion on the treatment you are considering.

First of all, you have so many infections that I truly believe that tackling them one by one with their traditional treatments—antibiotics, specific antivirals, and antiparasitics—would be overwhelming, intolerable, highly toxic, and ultimately ineffective. This has been my experience, as well as my partner’s, after years of antibiotics, disulfiram, dapsone, intravenous antibiotics, etc.

Additionally, my experience with antipurinergic therapies and my partner’s experience after a year and a half on them—despite not seeing dramatic clinical improvements—has shown significant progress in lab results. NK cell counts have increased, and all Lyme tests we have taken have turned negative, something antibiotics failed to achieve even after many years. This tells me that the strategy of exiting the CDR is fundamental, but it must be done properly and in a coordinated manner.

In this regard, in my opinion, the primary pathways to start restoring immune function, in order, would be purinergic receptors. Here, we encounter a problem: the currently available inhibitors—lidocaine cream for P2X7 inhibition and pannexin-1 inhibitors such as Brilliant Blue FCF and Probenecid—are certainly very potent, but since they reach the central nervous system, they may be difficult to tolerate due to their significant reduction of synaptic activity. However, it is also possible that the real issue is that they activate the immune system so strongly that they cause severe fatigue and overall worsening. 

Within the next 2-3 weeks or so, I believe that @m, my partner, and I, will be able to confirm this and assess whether suramin, which does not penetrate the central nervous system, is significantly better tolerated. If that turns out to be the case, I believe your best option would be to take suramin. If our test results are positive, we could (hopefully, if we can find a proper source) guide you on where to obtain it, how to test it, and how to use it, provided that you have the option to receive an intravenous infusion at home once a month.

On another note, I want to emphasize that inhibiting purinergic receptors is one of the most effective ways to restore overall immune function, halt CD8 lymphocyte depletion (as well as lymphocyte depletion in general), and reverse immune exhaustion.

The next approach, which I consider to be on par with the purinergic system, is GcMAF. This is because all studied pathogens to date, including HIV, influenza virus, herpesviruses, Borrelia, etc., produce nagalase, meaning they are capable of suppressing the immune system at the highest level—via macrophages. As you know, macrophages orchestrate both innate and adaptive immune responses and determine the appropriate course of action. Therefore, if you can find a genuine intravenous GcMAF, I would recommend taking it.

Regarding the direct inhibition of pathogen proliferation—and following the same approach of inhibiting all pathogens simultaneously, as we do with suramin and GcMAF—JHU seems like a perfect strategy. This is because glutamine metabolism is essential for all types of pathogens. Additionally, it will help reduce neuroinflammation caused by glutamate and NH3 and indirectly inhibit the itaconate shunt, thereby improving mitochondrial function.

I know you have developed a fear of inhibiting MTOR after having a very bad reaction. However, taking 0.1 mg of Everolimus daily should be well tolerated and could help overall in exiting the CDR and boosting the immune system.

As for RRX001, I have no idea how it will work, and in your case, I would wait to see how others respond to it first, as it might be excessively inflammatory for you. It could be a great drug, but I would approach it cautiously and observe its effects on others before trying it.

I would not take disulfiram; it is far too aggressive neurologically and can cause permanent neurocognitive damage, as has happened to many people, including my partner. I assure you, it is no miracle cure, and it does not eradicate Lyme when the immune system is this suppressed. This has been my experience, my partner’s, and that of many others with severe ME/CFS.

The TGF-β inhibitor seems excellent, but I also anticipate that it will be too potent. I would recommend either waiting to see how others tolerate it or starting with very, very low doses.

Alloferon, which functions similarly to Ampligen, could be ideal if you tolerate it. However, since it stimulates the innate immune response in a rather non-specific manner, it could also cause significant discomfort, so be cautious with it.

Regarding Cordyceps, Saccharomyces boulardii, Bacillus subtilis, lumbrokinase, and the GAPS diet—especially if done in a ketogenic and carnivore-adjacent way—they should help significantly. It will reduce inflammation, improve gut permeability (leaky gut), improve mitochondrial efficiency, lower ROS production and possibly decrease intestinal ammonia translocation, which could be highly beneficial.

A potentially less aggressive way to reduce TGF-β might be inhibiting AHR with TMS. The issue is that there are no human studies, so we are in uncharted territory. We will have to see how it affects us, but starting with the lowest possible dose used in studies, around 2 mg per day, could be an option to begin gradually restoring immune function. This is a central pathway in immune suppression as well IMO.

I definitely recommend Sephin1. It does not appear to cause issues for those who have tried it, and some have reported rapid improvement. It should help activate general cellular repair mechanisms allowing the immune system to get properly activated while decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress, increasing antioxidant capacity, etc. 

Regarding mitochondrial biogenesis stimulation with TQS, I assume it would be well-tolerated. However, my opinion is that mitochondria should be capable of inducing their own biogenesis when necessary and at the right time. This typically follows proper activation of the ISR, UPR, and mitochondrial UPR, along with autophagy processes. Therefore, forcing mitochondrial biogenesis during immune suppression may not be the best approach, but this remains a theoretical consideration that we will need to evaluate.

Finally, I believe you are right to avoid salicinium for now if it causes you discomfort. In my opinion (and I know this will be debated), inducing cellular apoptosis in an immunosuppressed system could trigger issues related to autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. It seems more appropriate to use it when the immune system is stronger or if you are able to tolerate it.

As for IMU, yes, it is an immunosuppressant, so I don’t think it’s the best strategy to boost your immune system. It is preferable to strengthen immune function so it can effectively clear chronic infections while simultaneously treating them with the strategies I mentioned above. If, as in your case, there is full lytic replication, using an antiviral seems appropriate.

On the other hand, I believe that inhibiting JAK1 may be essential and even necessary to tolerate the treatments. I consider two options here. The first is to boost the immune system with all the strategies mentioned above, and once it is strengthened, if you do not experience clear clinical improvement, then take Filgotinib. Alternatively, if you are unable to tolerate the treatments aimed at enhancing immune function, then take Filgotinib in very low or pulsed doses. This is something you should carefully consider. In my opinion, the itaconate shunt is fundamental for reversing immunosuppression and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Apologies for the length of this message, but I wanted to provide you with a thorough analysis of your treatment. I truly hope this serves as a useful guide to help refine your approach. 

I sincerely hope you find a way to tolerate treatments and achieve effective results! 





....

As for branched-chain amino acids that could feed into the TCA cycle, it’s tricky, since they could raise the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio again, which might be harmful — though it could be worth trying. Creatine, on the other hand, definitely shouldn't be a problem, as it follows a different pathway used primarily for explosive muscular movements.

But in cases like yours, where you've improved yet are still very ill, I’d be more cautious. Increasing glycolytic flux could be problematic — for instance, using amino acid precursors or activating PDH with DCA. And too many antioxidants could worsen reductive stress, so I'm not sure about CoQ10, for example, or even acetyl-L-carnitine, since fatty acid oxidation might also increase reductive stress. So it's really very person-dependent and depends on their current state.

That said, I myself reached a very good point thanks to GcMAF — I was going to the gym four times a week, driving, attending classes, etc. I was at 50–70% of my baseline, and yet mitochondrial supplements didn’t do anything for me. So I think that — even if you do benefit from mitochondrial-targeted therapies — boosting the immune system to clear the root causes of mitochondrial dysfunction is key.




## TCAP1

I’ve studied the issue of reductive stress in the context of the TCAP-1 peptide, and here is a summary of the mechanism involved.

Under normal physiological conditions, when neurons fire, there is a transient influx of calcium into the cytoplasm. A portion of this calcium is taken up by mitochondria through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), which activates calcium-dependent dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle and enhances oxidative phosphorylation.

However, under acute or sustained stress, particularly mediated by CRF, this system becomes dysregulated. Similar to what Wirth has described in muscle cells, CRF induces a significant rise in both cytosolic calcium and sodium. The elevated intracellular sodium promotes forward-mode activity of the mitochondrial Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCLX), leading to extrusion of calcium from the mitochondrial matrix. At the same time, CRF also triggers a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) through calcium-independent mechanisms—such as phosphorylation of respiratory complexes and rapid ROS generation. The combined effect is a reduction in mitochondrial calcium uptake via the MCU, which impairs activation of TCA cycle enzymes and leads to reduced oxidative phosphorylation.

In this state, CRF causes an accumulation of NADH due to reduced flux through the electron transport chain, accompanied by a drop in both ΔΨm and ATP production. This creates a biochemical profile consistent with reductive stress: high NADH, low NAD⁺, low ATP, and impaired electron transfer.

The addition of TCAP-1 reverses this process. It redirects calcium into the mitochondria—by restoring ΔΨm and facilitating Ca²⁺ entry through the MCU—and simultaneously reduces cytosolic calcium levels via enhanced extrusion. This dual effect restores mitochondrial function by reactivating the TCA cycle and enhancing the oxidation of NADH to NAD⁺, thus allowing electrons to properly enter the electron transport chain and generate ATP efficiently. As a result, TCAP-1 improves mitochondrial bioenergetics and resolves reductive stress.

Furthermore, by reducing cytosolic calcium, TCAP-1 decreases CRF exocytosis. In brain regions such as the limbic system, and particularly in the dorsal raphe nucleus, this would result in reduced activation of CRF receptor 2 (CRF-R2). Lower CRF-R2 activity would in turn diminish the synthesis and release of serotonin from the raphe, reducing serotonergic drive to downstream limbic structures. This prevents desensitization of the serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT₁A), which is normally responsible for tonically inhibiting CRF-R2 expression. Preserving 5-HT₁A function therefore helps re-establish inhibitory control over CRF-R2 and reduces chronic serotonergic activation, which may play a key role in the limbic-driven inflammation seen in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.

So just to sum it up:

1. Chronic stress= CDR3A/ hypometabolism = low Mito calcium= immune exhaustion =low membrane potential =low ATP

2. Proper immune activation = CDR1= proper Immune activation = higher mito calcium= high membrane potential =high ATP

3. Too much activation = too much Mito Calcium= low membrane potential =low ATP

And then we go again to point 1.

So this peptide makes us go from 1 to 2

For neurons is kind of the same, but I think it is easier to visualize with immune cells


I'll answer more thoroughly regarding the details of this study, as it clearly illustrates how, at the early stages of the disease and/or in milder patients, there is a predominance of CDR1—characterized by high mitochondrial membrane potential, high GSH, and elevated mitochondrial calcium. As the disease progresses, however, immune activation can no longer be sustained, leading to a state of low-grade inflammation and predominant immune EXHAUSTION with potentially low Mito calcium



I’ve been thoroughly reviewing the study, and here’s my interpretation. It’s crucial to remember that at the early stages of ME/CFS—or in milder cases—there is a greater inflammatory capacity. This means that a higher proportion of immune cells remain in a CDR1-dominant state, where elevated extracellular ATP leads to cytosolic calcium influx, which in turn increases mitochondrial calcium uptake. This rise in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which initially triggers antioxidant response pathways such as the integrated stress response (ISR), along with activation of sirtuins and the NRF2 axis, promoting transcription of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione synthetase, superoxide dismutase, etc.

In this study, we see that female ME/CFS patients display a clearly more proinflammatory/CDR1-like profile, characterized by elevated ROS, increased proliferation of activated T cells, and higher mitochondrial calcium. Notably, they also exhibit greater antioxidant compensation, as reflected by elevated levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). In contrast, male patients show signs of a later-stage or exhausted response, with lower GSH, normalized mitochondrial calcium, and dampened ROS levels.

One particularly interesting finding is that early in the disease, there appears to be not only an increase in mitochondrial calcium but also a rise in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). In the supplementary material, when sexes are pooled, we observe a clear upward trend in both ΔΨm and mitochondrial biogenesis in ME/CFS—although not statistically significant. Unfortunately, due to the small sample size, sex-stratified analysis was not conducted. However, it seems likely that, had it been done, females would show higher ΔΨm and mitochondrial mass than controls, whereas males might show the opposite trend.

In my opinion, the data presented are not representative of long-term or severe ME/CFS, as most studies in those populations report decreased ΔΨm, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, and normalized GSH levels, often indistinguishable from healthy controls. That said, this study is highly informative from a progression standpoint—it likely captures a shift from CDR1 predominance to a more hypometabolic, CDR3a-like state in advanced disease.

Several factors could explain these findings. First, the sample size is small, which limits statistical power. Second, as often happens, participants in clinical research tend to be moderately affected, thus skewing results toward a more proinflammatory profile. Third, the study finds a positive correlation between BMI and ROS levels, particularly in long COVID. Although not explored in depth here, it’s conceivable that female patients may have higher BMI early in disease due to immobility and estrogen-driven fat accumulation, which could independently amplify inflammation. Measuring insulin resistance in both sexes would have added valuable insight.

Additionally, high estrogen levels in females likely contribute to the proinflammatory skew, as estrogens are known to modulate antioxidant enzyme expression and T cell activation through ERα signaling.

In summary, treatments effective in proinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, lupus, or Alzheimer’s may not be effective in late-stage, hypometabolic ME/CFS with immunosuppression, but might be helpful in early or moderately inflamed patients. This distinction is critical when selecting therapies.

In my opinion, the data presented are not representative of long-term or severe ME/CFS, as most studies in those populations report decreased ΔΨm, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, and normalized GSH levels, often indistinguishable from healthy controls


## Autoimmunity, IgG

The question you’re asking is central to the pathophysiology of ME/CFS and is also extremely complex. Below, I summarise some of the mechanisms by which antibodies from ME/CFS patients, forming immune complexes with a wide range of proteins, can affect mitochondria in healthy cells, as observed in many studies.

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a single autoantibody responsible for driving the CDR. It would be much simpler if that were the case. As you’ll see in the explanation below, there are many different antibodies bound to many types of proteins — microbial, self, inflammatory, complement-associated, etc. — which essentially indicates ongoing autoimmune processes that form part of the immunological memory perpetuating the CDR. This is why therapies such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or, in the future, experimental approaches that eliminate long-lived plasma cells make sense for targeting this immunological component of the self-perpetuating disease cycle.

However, this humoral response must be put into context: it is not a primary driver. For example, it is plausible that nearly all people with ME/CFS harbour Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, or other unknown variants, even if we give them less attention than we should. Borrelia is known to induce the host to generate anti-collagen humoral responses in order to degrade collagen for its own benefit. This could account for part of what I’ve described above. Similarly, the persistence of Epstein–Barr virus in an abortive replication mode is an evolutionary strategy for pushing the host into a CDR, immunosuppressing them, and ensuring viral persistence. Secondarily, antibodies against viral particles form. In other words, the autoantibodies are secondary to the primary pathogenesis of ME/CFS.

Interestingly, if autoantibodies played a dominant role in ME/CFS pathophysiology, we would expect most of us to respond positively to IVIG or immunoadsorption therapies. Yet this is not the case, except in studies involving less severely affected, more autoreactive individuals, who in my opinion have a stronger predominance of autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity than the very severe ME/CFS patients who are unable to participate in studies.

Finally, to illustrate this hierarchy of importance: one of Prusty’s key findings was that fibronectin levels within immunoglobulin complexes were low, but fibronectin levels in plasma were high and capable of activating TLR4, driving the CDR, etc. This was linked to EBV or HHV-6 acting on B1 plasma cells in the bone marrow, reducing natural IgM levels. Interestingly, suramin has been shown to increase natural IgM and decrease fibronectin-1. This is a clear example of how such alterations are secondary to a CDR state — involving alarmins, cytokines, and persistent microbes — that perpetuates a hypometabolic state in which the humoral response also plays its role in maintaining this cycle.

Possible mechanisms by which IgG/IgM immune complexes from ME/CFS or Long COVID can drive a CDR in otherwise healthy cells are as follows. These antibodies often circulate as immune complexes with host antigens—e.g., extracellular-matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin) or complement factors—and, in some reports, with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antigens as well. The dominant cargo seems to track clinical phenotype: in ME/CFS, complexes are relatively enriched for extracellular-matrix proteins, whereas in Long COVID they more often include coagulation-cascade proteins.

First, pattern-recognition signaling can be triggered directly at the surface (e.g., fibronectin-containing complexes engaging TLR4 and integrins) or after FcγR/FcRn-mediated uptake of the immune complex. Internalized complexes can expose endosomal TLRs (TLR7/8/9) to nucleic-acid cargo and/or viral components—including EBV-antigen–bound IgGs—amplifying interferon programs, NF-κB/IRF activation, and a shift toward an antiviral, hypometabolic CDR.

Second, direct receptor modulation by Fab can occur when autoantibodies target cell-surface receptors such as GPCRs (e.g., β2-adrenergic, muscarinic M3/M4). Chronic agonism/antagonism skews cAMP/Ca²⁺/MAPK signaling that governs mitochondrial fusion–fission, promoting mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced OXPHOS, and lower ATP. These Fab-driven effects can synergize with Fc/FcγR/TLR/integrin signaling to stabilize the CDR state.

Together, these routes—PRR activation by ECM/viral-antigen–containing complexes, Fc-dependent internalization and endosomal sensing, and Fab-mediated receptor bias—converge on a shared outcome: a durable antiviral, pro-inflammatory, hypometabolic program that recapitulates key cellular features of ME/CFS or Long COVID.

Thus, although all of this may sound highly complex, if we widen the lens, it becomes less so. ME/CFS is potentially triggered by chronic infections that have managed to persist for a variety of reasons that, at some point, led to an immunosuppressed state — for example, heavy metal intoxication, exposure to mold, severe stress, and other insults. This hypometabolic CDR state is perpetuated both by the ongoing action of microbes and by what I call “sterile” vicious cycles, in which the immune system itself — both humoral and cellular — plays a central role. This includes  autoantibodies, memory B and T cells, among others.

We also have other sterile perpetuation circuits at the neuronal level, such as those involving the amygdala, hypothalamus, or other parts of the limbic system. This has been clearly demonstrated in mice: perfectly healthy animals, when the same neurons are activated that would be in infection-induced sickness behaviour, develop the illness phenotype without any pathogen present. Additionally, there is a form of sterile memory involving alarmins — extracellular ATP, interferon-alpha, succinate, fumarate, mitochondrial DNA, and so on. Lastly, we have persistent “memory” embedded in mitochondrial and cellular membranes, especially in lipid rafts, which tend to lock the cell into an antiviral, CDR-like state.

However, all of this can be corrected. Primarily, we must remove the main source of these alarmins and the proteins that will later become autoantibody targets — in other words, chronically infected cells. Then, we must enable uninfected, otherwise healthy cells to exit the CDR state — both naturally, as alarmin and inflammation levels fall, and through targeted therapies, such as anti-purinergics, mTOR inhibitors... , which can actively promote exit from that state. In parallel, we must strengthen the immune system and block sterile infection circuits by using different strategies: modulating the limbic system, improving membrane lipid composition, depleting long-lived plasma cells, and immunosuppressing with agents such as filgotinib or analogous drugs to reduce chronic inflammation and also break the itaconate cycle.

## Immediate vs progressive sickness

You’re absolutely right. I also became ill within the span of an hour — I went to take a nap feeling fine and woke up with severe CFS.

 In the early phase, there’s a predominance of a pro-inflammatory CDR1, and the very same mechanisms that sustain this state are the ones that eventually drive you into immunosuppression and perpetuate the disease.

You weren’t immunodepressed from the very beginning, but there was likely a dual situation in which parts of your immune system were already weakened — for example, due to dental amalgams, mold exposure, root canals, or long-term sustained stress, etc. — which allowed certain infections to gain ground. These could have been chronic, like Epstein–Barr virus, or acute, like COVID in recent years.

In such a scenario, your already somewhat compromised immune system was unable to clear the infection. The adaptive strategies of the pathogen took hold and, little by little, in order to ensure its own persistence, pushed you into a CDR state with chronic inflammation that inevitably causes symptoms. 

At first, you’re in a pro-inflammatory state, but one that’s relatively ineffective; over the years, this shifts into an immunosuppressed state — unable to mount robust responses to stimuli, yet marked by a low-grade, chronic inflammatory tone.

And this inherent inflammation causes the symtoms, from the very beginning...

Hey [x]  again. There’s something you asked that I didn’t answer, and I think it’s important. When you say you became ill in a single day and point out that you can’t become immunosuppressed in a day, the thing is — it doesn’t work quite like that. You can have the illness developing silently over many years, but there’s often a moment when the inflammatory and defensive signals reaching the brain switch the system from a healthy homeostasis to a sickness homeostasis. That switch is essentially a brain-mediated decision and can occur within minutes.

For example, my partner has experienced several episodes where, after receiving homeopathic doses of multiple Borrelia, Babesia, and Bartonella strains together, she went from being bedridden to, within an hour, getting up, her face visibly changing, all signs of inflammation diminishing, and being able to go out shopping. When I was in a more moderate state and took amphetamines to get through hospital training shifts, I felt perfectly healthy during those eight hours. The same has happened with LDI to me, and the first time I took D-ribose I had ten consecutive days of complete remission, literally from one day to the next.

What I mean is that, regardless of your immune or inflammatory status, there’s also a central nervous system interpretation of the systemic “safety” context that can shift within seconds. This is why it’s possible to become acutely ill within hours — but that momentary switch does not reflect the full underlying evolution of what’s been happening in the background for years.

Similarly, recovery from the illness often follows the same pattern, as noted for example by Dr. Sarah Myhill. You can spend years doing everything right — detoxifying, strengthening the immune system, taking antimicrobials, improving diet, treating leaky gut and fermenting gut, and so on — with little noticeable improvement. Then, suddenly, within days, you start to get better. It’s as if there’s a threshold that must be crossed, which you may not perceive clinically while it’s happening. But once you pass it, the improvement becomes apparent very quickly.

## Difference between other chronic infections?

> You mention HIV, which is a chronic infection and presumably CDR would not be shut off and in fact progress to CDR3, since HIV is one of the most immune suppressive infections there is. How come that (to my knowledge, at least) most HIV patients don't have PEM? Is the body's reaction (ie what symptoms it will produce) in face of CDR then determined by genetics?

That’s a very good question, and I don’t really have a definitive answer, but I can hypothesize.

Naviaux proposes that infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions, and some forms of autism belong to the CDR3 category, which represents chronic CDR. But in his most recent work (2023), he realized he needed to create a new category for hypometabolic or fatiguing illnesses—those that cause ME/CFS after infection, whether it’s Long COVID, Epstein-Barr virus, tick-borne diseases, and so on.

It’s interesting that all chronic infections like HIV, hepatitis, or tuberculosis are accompanied by significant fatigue. And there are studies showing that some of these patients can go on to develop ME/CFS. For example, here is a study showing that tuberculosis patients are more likely to develop ME/CFS:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35189895/

Similarly, patients with hepatitis undergoing interferon treatment have also been shown to develop ME/CFS, although I assume in this case it is because the interferon-α/JAK1/itaconate cycle is triggered.

Clearly the same applies to COVID, even though it is not a chronic infection, and the same has been observed with Coxsackie or Epstein-Barr infections—where after some months you may either recover or develop ME/CFS.

What remains unclear to me is why, as you point out, people with diseases like HIV or hepatitis suffer from a lot of fatigue, but sometimes benefit from moderate exercise. Although intense exercise has been shown to worsen their fatigue, it does not cause the delayed worsening at 48 hours that we see in ME/CFS.

It is as if they retain a greater functional reserve than we do: their mitochondria are able to respond to exertion, perhaps by increasing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation despite a rise in free radicals, and possibly also by boosting anaerobic ATP production in the cytoplasm. In contrast, we lack that functional reserve. My intuition is that in these conditions, fatigue is caused mainly by inflammatory cytokines, not by the same mechanism as in ME/CFS, where the picture is more consistent with sickness behavior at the level of the central nervous system (particularly the limbic system), and with an exhausted CDR3A—hypersensitized to everything that signals danger, whether it’s extracellular ATP, interferon-α, succinate, cardiolipin, reactive oxygen species, LPS, and so on.

Perhaps one piece of evidence for this, at least in my own case, is that when I was in a more moderate state and taking methylphenidate to be able to attend classes and hospital rotations, I always found it remarkable that taking high doses of these stimulants for eight hours did not cause PEM. Yet in the same state, without stimulants but forcing myself to do things, I did experience PEM. I believe these stimulants, by increasing dopamine, temporarily reduced the sickness behavior of the central nervous system and prevented the onset of PEM. This has always struck me and is something I have thought about for a long time.

If you think about it carefully, there is a fundamental difference between chronic infections and ME/CFS. Chronic infections, if untreated, can be fatal—HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis. ME/CFS, on the other hand, drives the body into a hypometabolic state and a CDR. At the cellular level, this allows cells to upregulate their antiviral and antimicrobial defenses dramatically, which is the very function of the CDR: it protects cells from dying  from these infections, but at the cost of chronic systemic symptoms.

As an example, there are people with Borrelia burgdorferi infection who die without developing ME/CFS but instead present with severe neurological, muscular, vascular autoimmune manifestations—highly inflammatory and sometimes lethal. By contrast, people with ME/CFS and Borrelia infection (the majority in my experience) enter that hibernation-like state, where reduced inflammation, paradoxically, seems to protect us.

## IFN gamma

IFN-γ (interferon gamma) is the key cytokine in the adaptive TH1-type immune response. When a macrophage detects a bacterial or viral antigen via TLR activation, it produces and releases IL-12, which then stimulates both NK cells and CD8⁺ T cells. These cells, in turn, produce and release IFN-γ, which further activates the macrophage. This loop helps promote a proper TH1 (and sometimes TH17) response, enhances MHC-I and MHC-II expression, and primes the immune system for pathogen clearance.

However, this adaptive response takes 4–5 days to fully develop in response to a new antigen. In the meantime, TLR activation triggers an immediate innate response via NF-κB and the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I), mainly IFN-α and IFN-β.

In the early hours, IFN-α is central to launching the innate antiviral program, primarily through the induction of ISGs (interferon-stimulated genes). These include:

PKR: Activates the ISR (Integrated Stress Response) by phosphorylating eIF2α, thereby suppressing viral (and host) protein synthesis.

OAS/RNase L: Destroys viral RNA.

Other ISGs that encode various antimicrobial proteins.


At this point, cells enter an acute CDR1 metabolic state, prioritizing defense over growth and protein synthesis.

One particularly important ISG is IRG1 (also known as ACOD1), which drives itaconate production. Itaconate disrupts the TCA cycle, creating a low-energy, antimicrobial metabolic state. It also has direct antiviral and pro-inflammatory effects in early infection and amplifies its own pathway by upregulating IFN-α, which induces more IRG1, generating a positive feedback loop.

As days pass, signals driven by IFN-α also support the priming of the adaptive immune system, promoting activation of CD4⁺ T cells, CD8⁺ T cells, and B cells, which differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies. At this stage, in intracellular infections, inflammation becomes dominated by IFN-γ.

What I’ve described so far reflects what happens in acute infection. But in our case — dealing with chronic infections and immune dysfunction — the scenario changes.

If these inflammatory loops were not self-limiting, they would be lethal. Indeed, in early COVID-19 strains, patients with metabolic or immune compromise (e.g., insulin resistance) often experienced fatal hyperinflammation. It is well described that chronic elevation of IFN-γ leads to immune downregulation. Similarly, prolonged IFN-α signaling — especially through sustained itaconate production — leads to strong immunosuppression.

This makes sense: once a pathogen is cleared, the immune system needs to shut down the response. But the problem arises when pathogen persistence causes these defense pathways to remain chronically active, leading to ongoing immune exhaustion.

Over time, hyperactivation of immune cells leads to energetic collapse: both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) decline. As a result, protein synthesis drops, including synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines like IFN-γ, which explains why IFN-γ levels are low in chronic fatigue or immune exhaustion states.

However, mitochondrial failure leads to the release of mtDNA, which activates the cGAS-STING pathway, inducing type I interferons (including IFN-α). Simultaneously:

mTOR is activated by mitochondrial stress and further promotes IFN-α production.

Purinergic receptors, which are activated in both acute danger and cellular exhaustion, also upregulate IFN-α.

Itaconate itself contributes to IFN-α induction.

So although IFN-α is essential in early immune activation, in chronic infections such as ME/CFS, tuberculosis, HIV, or late-stage sepsis, elevated IFN-α becomes a driver of sustained immune suppression and exhaustion.

Thus, in chronic infections with an exhausted immune system, we often observe reduced IFN-γ alongside persistently elevated IFN-α — or at least in specific dysfunctional immune cell subsets.

## Is IFNa always bad for us?

It is context dependent. Let me share a compilation of studies about this subject. We definitely fall under the second context IMO unless we are in the early phase of the disease:

Type I interferons, especially IFN-α, can act as both immune stimulants and suppressors depending on dosage, context, and exposure duration. In early HIV infection or controlled administration, IFN-α can enhance CD8+ T cell activation, as seen in Manion et al. (2012). However, in chronic exposure or advanced disease, high levels of IFN-α promote immunosuppression through IL-10 induction, PD-L1 expression, and lymphocyte apoptosis. This biphasic behavior reflects a priming effect at low doses and receptor saturation or desensitization at high doses, contributing to immune exhaustion in chronic infections.

IFN I tolerance

LTB4 signalling via the BLT1 receptor enhances the activation of the type I IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which leads to IFN-α production by interstitial macrophages to suppress in situ IMM proliferation.

IFNa índice immune-suppression i. HIV Patients
Persistently high levels of IP-10, and particularly IFN-α, are associated with lack of immunological response as reflected by CD4+ cell increase. Notably, a lack of decline or even a rise in these cytokines was an early indicator of immunological treatment failure, and as for IFN-α, even high baseline levels appear to predict such treatment failure. Furthermore, our finding of a marked suppressive effect of IFN-α on PHA-induced PBMC proliferation, even in concentrations comparable to circulating levels in HIV-infected patients, suggests that the association between immunological treatment failure and persistently high IFN-α levels are not only parallel phenomena, but rather reflect an important immunopathogenic role of IFN-α associated with impaired numerical and functional restoration of CD4+ T cells during HAART.

(...) Mechanisms for the suppressive effect of IFN-α on lymphocyte proliferation are therefore unclear, but may involve factors such as enhanced production of cytokines with anti-proliferative effects (e.g. IL-10).
(...) Whatever the mechanisms, our findings, in addition to the recent demonstration of inhibitory effects of IFN-α on production of chemokines [17] and IL-12 [38], suggest a role for IFN-α in HIV-related disease and immunodeficiency.

Low doses cause immune stimulation and high doses immune-suppression
They referred to this hyperresponsiveness of IFN-pretreated cells as “priming.” Lockhart (61) subsequently reported that pretreatment of cells with low concentrations of IFN enhanced their ability to secrete IFN when subsequently induced, whereas pretreatment with higher concentrations of IFN inhibited their ability to synthesize IFN. This phenomenon of low-dose priming and high-dose blocking has been described in numerous IFN induction systems (reviewed by Stewart (62)). Although this phenomenon has not been fully explained, one likely possibility is that low-dose IFN primes for an enhanced response by upregulation of IFN receptors on the cell surface, whereas higher doses would saturate surface receptors and downregulate subsequent responses to secondary induction.

Central to the argument that an orally administered low dose of IFN-α is a priming signal for immune response via interactions with IFN-α receptors on the immune system is the observation by Havell and Spital (29) that pretreatment of murine Mf with low doses of IFN-α/β (1–10 IU) markedly enhanced their IFN-α/β responses to endotoxin. In contrast, pretreatment of Mf with 100–1,000 IU of IFN-α/β markedly suppressed their subsequent response to endotoxin. These authors demonstrated a similar low-dose priming, high-dose blocking of Mf responses with IFN-γ pretreatment. The concentrations of IFN-α/β generating the Mf priming responses are remarkably similar to the concentrations of orally administered IFN.

HIV-1 disease progression is associated with depletion of human leukocytes including human CD4+ T cells.
Although several reports show that persistent ISG induction is correlated with disease progression in HIV-1–infected patients (...)
Study: We found that IFNAR1 blockade rescued both the number and function of human T cells, and prevented HIV-1–induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis, in spite of higher levels of virus replication. Thus, sustained IFN-I signaling plays a major role in CD4+ T cell depletion during persistent HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, we found that IFNAR1 blockade increased the expression of activation markers CD38/HLA-DR and Ki-67 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and was positively correlated with HIV-1 viremia.
(...) IFN-Is are critical to the death of human T cells during chronic HIV-1 infection.
(...) Blocking IFN-I signaling with an anti-IFNAR1 mAb can enhance antiviral immune responses and prevent or accelerate clearance of persistent LCMV infection in mice (16, 17).

So in mild patient's still in a very inflammatory state, you could still promote a proper innate and adquiered Th1 response. But over time as the immune exhaustion progresses and get chronic, the chances are you'll be making the problem worse

## Fibrosis and CDR2

Yeah, that's correct! Fibrotic diseases, generally framed within CDR2, do indeed have severe oxygen diffusion problems. This is because fibrosis increases the distance between the capillary and the cell, so no matter how much oxygen is present in the capillary, it simply doesn’t reach the cells effectively. 

However, we are not at that stage. We don’t have such extensive sclerotic tissue as seen in those conditions that would prevent oxygen from reaching the cells. Perhaps in older individuals, where ME/CFS coexists with other comorbidities, this could be an issue, and these people might benefit from supplemental oxygen. But in 20-40 years-old with severe ME/CFS, this level of fibrosis is not present. Their venous and arterial oxygen levels are high, and CO₂ levels are low. This suggests that oxygen is not being properly utilized by the mitochondria in my opinion. 

Otherwise, supplemental O2 and HBOT would be beneficial for many of us, and it is not for most.

## Calcium and sodium

Exactly, this is what I was referring to, which is what Naviaux mentions in his study. 

In any case, independently of the lipid-mediated memory formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, the key focus, in my opinion, should be on interrupting the signaling pathways that lead to elevated cytosolic calcium, which are not limited to P2Y receptors. While P2Y receptors primarily mobilize intracellular calcium through IP3-mediated release from the ER, P2X receptors, including P2X7, directly allow extracellular calcium influx. 

Additionally, the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), which typically exports calcium in exchange for sodium, can reverse its function under conditions of elevated intracellular sodium—such as impaired Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity due to ATP depletion and oxidative stress. This reversal leads to calcium influx, exacerbating cytosolic calcium overload.

Furthermore, the endoplasmic reticulum stress increases CHOP which activates ERO1α, which in turn  increases ROS production during protein folding by promoting disulfide bond formation. Elevated ROS levels stimulate calcium release from the ER via IP3 receptors, signaling mitochondria and triggering the production of mitochondrial-derived danger-associated molecular patterns. 

Moreover, there are other pathways, including free radicals, mTOR, NF-κB, TGFb, that also stimulate calcium entry into the cytoplasm and the calcium flow from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria. 

This is why, in my opinion, it is crucial to inhibit purinergic receptors and all other metabolic pathways that lead to this process in the first place.

---

Well, it starts with high cytoplasmic calcium, as far as I know.

So, and this is something I am working on, I think that in CDR1 there is high calcium in the mitochondria, but in CDR3b, there is low calcium.

In fact, this happens in senescent cells, which are in CDR2 but have high NADH, like in CFS, so I'd say the same occurs in CFS.

Actually, Wirth's theory kind of describes this dual scenario. Here is something I wrote about it you might find interesting:

(the high sodium starts due to low ATP, ROS and excess adrenergic signal at the NA-K ATPasa)

The excess of sodium reverses NCX (normally imports sodium and exports calcium), so now sodium is released and calcium is imported

in this scenario, intracellular K+ is lost: In ME/CFS, intracellular potassium decreases due to two mechanisms: impaired Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity and prolonged opening of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. The Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase cannot effectively reintroduce potassium into the cell due to low ATP and oxidative stress, while the KATP channels open under ATP depletion, allowing excessive potassium efflux. This potassium loss weakens the potassium gradient, reducing the cell’s ability to maintain a negative resting membrane potential. As a result, the membrane depolarizes, making it easier to activate voltage-dependent calcium channels, increasing calcium influx, which exacerbates muscle dysfunction, cramps, and energy imbalance.

** we can differentiate this scenario at rest and after exercise in CFS:
At rest in ME/CFS, intracellular sodium levels are slightly elevated but not high enough to reverse the NCX (sodium-calcium exchanger) on the sarcolemma. This moderate sodium elevation reduces the efficiency of the NCX, making it less effective at exporting calcium from the cytoplasm, though it does not reverse its direction. Meanwhile, the elevated sodium enhances the activity of the mitochondrial NCLX, which uses the sodium gradient to export calcium from the mitochondria. This potentially leads to reduced mitochondrial calcium levels, impairing ATP production since calcium is crucial for activating key enzymes in the Krebs cycle. Additionally, the mild cytoplasmic calcium elevation, combined with reduced mitochondrial calcium, promotes a shift toward glycolysis even at rest, contributing to excessive lactate production and fatigue.
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IT CALCIUM IS LOW IN THE MITOCHONDRIA AT REST.

During exercise, cytoplasmic sodium levels rise significantly, surpassing the threshold to reverse the NCX on the sarcolemma. This reversal causes a sudden influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, sharply elevating cytoplasmic calcium levels. The excess calcium enters the mitochondria through the MCU (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) and VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel). Simultaneously, the rapid calcium influx depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane, slowing down the NCLX (This is from a above study) , which further reduces calcium export from the mitochondria. At this stage, mitochondrial calcium overload occurs because the combined effects of reduced calcium export via the NCLX and excessive calcium influx overwhelm the mitochondria's regulatory capacity. The calcium-ATPase on the sarcolemma, which uses ATP to export calcium, has limited transport capacity and cannot keep pace with the rapid calcium influx during exercise. This explains why mitochondrial calcium might become deficient at rest but shifts to dangerous overload during exertion, contributing to oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction characteristic of PEM.

Sure, this is the same issue I see in the group with many other drugs: we look for treatments to reduce inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in a generic way, and these treatments are usually used for more inflammatory autoimmune diseases or even CDR3A or highly pro-inflammatory states in CDR1. Of course, in highly pro-inflammatory diseases, mitochondrial calcium is likely to be consistently elevated, making it beneficial. Whereas in ME/CFS, that might not be the case. I’m not certain, though, as I spent several days searching for studies on mitochondrial calcium levels in exhausted immune cells, which are characteristic of what happens to us systemically, and there are no measurements available anywhere.

It’s somewhat similar to what happens with mitochondrial uncouplers, which lower the membrane potential. In pro-inflammatory diseases where there’s high NAD+, and a drop in NADH, resulting in excessive oxidative stress in the mitochondria and membrane hyperpolarization, this works very well. Meanwhile, further depolarizing the membrane in an exhausted immune cell--as ocurrs in CFS--would only deplete it more.

This is further complicated by the fact that in ME/CFS, when we exert ourselves and enter PEM, we do transiently shift to CDR1, at least in some immune cells. Therefore, these types of therapies might help eliminate excess CDR1. Since immune exhaustion is often due to an initial excess of CDR1, they might gradually reduce the number of cells entering exhaustion, so it’s not entirely black and white, of course.

## Single-receptor interventions vs general homeostasis-promoting interventinos

The only thing is that, in my view, it is preferable to stimulate the immune system by inhibiting or activating those CDR pathways that infections alter to immunosuppress us, since these are usually better tolerated therapies, such as inhibiting mTOR (although not always well tolerated by everyone), using antipurinergics, taking GcMAF, inhibiting glutamine with JHU-083, inhibiting AHR with TMS, inhibiting ACOD1/itaconate, etc. I believe these pathways are highly effective at stimulating the immune system and with fewer side effects and they stimulate the immune response in a physiological way. 

Problem is that with a single receptor or through only one pathway, you end up overstimulating one part while the rest of the immune system remains exhausted. 

> That's a good point, I've been thinking about the exact same thing this week actually, but in more general terms. That is, even if we identify all the key bottlenecks in a system, how can we ensure that we apply the right ratio of inputs at each point so that we achieve the optimal homeostasis and don't just push the system into another undesired state, due to some unintended asymmetry? This is actually a rather difficult problem in large-scale distributed systems, which biology more or less is, so the analogy strikes me as pertinent.

I completely agree with you, and in fact that’s why, although my starting point is always individual mechanisms and how they connect with each other, when it comes to deciding whether a treatment is the right one or not, I prefer to look at the final outcome in an in vivo model—especially of chronic infection if such a model exists, and if not, of cancer, since cancer cells and infected cells are quite similar and so are their immunological profiles, though with some nuances.

Therefore, now that we are talking about MENK, when you investigate the mechanisms through which it works, they are multiple and encompass a large part of those pathways that perpetuate the state of immunosuppression. Specifically, it acts through three receptors simultaneously, decreasing the excessive entry of Ca²⁺ into the cell and into the mitochondria, reducing the IL-6 → ↓STAT3/HIF-1α axis directly, and indirectly reducing mTOR and GSK3β. This leads to a global reduction of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress. In other words, it acts at many different levels and enhances all branches of the immune system in vivo, without increasing harmful and useless inflammation (TNFα, complement, TH17, etc.).

Another example: if you study basic immunology, you realize that everything starts with professional antigen-presenting cells, mainly dendritic cells and macrophages. Thus, it is not surprising that all microbes studied so far are capable of releasing an enzyme called nagalase, which breaks down the molecule that activates these two cells in the body, called GcMAF. Therefore, when you administer exogenous GcMAF, you are bypassing this inhibition and thereby activating the immune system from the top down—both the innate and the adaptive response. Absolutely all the pathways required for proper immune activation.

Thus, it is the studies that must demonstrate that the response is global, balanced, and without triggering a cytokine cascade that could be harmful.

## GcMAF

The best results I have seen, by far, come from GcMAF, which improves roughly 70% of ME/CFS patients by about 50–70%—a remarkably high response rate. So this pathway appears to be truly fundamental. However When I reached a 70% functionality with GcMAF I was not fully recovered, so something was missing

## Genetics & HLA

That said, most of us were perfectly healthy well into our 20s, 30s, or even 40s. So while genetic susceptibility certainly plays a role, it does not negate the fact that we were able to live in the world, exposed to diverse infections, while maintaining a robust and balanced immune system. The problem seems to arise when cumulative circumstances—primarily infections and toxins—overwhelm immune capacity. Perhaps our “exhaustion threshold” is simply lower than in others who are predisposed instead to autoimmunity or different pathologies.

As you know, the central focus of my research is exactly this: identifying the mechanisms by which immune cells become exhausted. And there is much more to it than persistent antigens. Immunologically, cells can be driven into exhaustion by extracellular ATP overload, chronic IFN-α exposure, excess ROS, ER stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction by
 metabolites originating from gut dysbiosis and fermentation (D-lactate, ammonia, alcohols, etc.). And there are many more examples: Nearly all studied microbes produce nagalase, directly inhibiting macrophage activation. Most pathogens in some way manipulate purinergic signaling: either by increasing extracellular adenosine (immunosuppressive), driving ATP release into the extracellular space (which eventually suppresses immunity), inducing chronic ISR activation with CHOP upregulation, or conversely inhibiting ISR to blunt host repair defenses, or upregulating mTOR to suppress mitochondria and immune function, or inhibit autophagy to impare proper antigen presentation and induce mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, most microbes studied have shown to inhibit VDR in order to impare the secretion of natural antimicrobial and shut down a big part of our innate response. So microbes have developed an extensive array of such strategies to directly induce immunosuppression.

The mechanism described in the paper—where low-affinity antibodies, macrophages, and chronic antigen presentation to T cells drive sustained IFN-γ release and macrophage activation—may indeed be part of the broader CDR-related immunosuppressive cycle, but probably mainly in patients with a strongly proinflammatory profile. In fact, in most long-term severe ME/CFS patients I see, IFN-γ is low (though not in all cases). For example, this study shows IFN-γ elevated early on, but falling below control levels over time:

10.1126/sciadv.1400121

## HLA

And I fully agree with you: it is obviously not all genetics. Otherwise, I would not have lived 22 years perfectly healthy, nor would my mother —she also suffers from ME/CFS—have lived 55 years perfectly healthy, etc. The issue is more likely an accumulation of toxic exposures, deficiencies in essential nutrients, non-ionizing EMF exposure at both low and high frequencies, pesticide exposure, heavy metals from amalgams, deodorants, vaccines, fish, etc., repeated antigenic stimulation from vaccines, and a microbial burden that eventually overwhelms the system. And indeed, those who develop autoimmune diseases tend to have HLAs that are better equipped to recognize antigens, which makes them overly efficient and prone to overshooting the response, so to speak. In contrast, in people like us, our less efficient HLA types predispose us to a higher likelihood of entering this state of chronic infections. But I am convinced we can return to the state we once had when we were healthy, where the immune system was competent.

## Autism via RNA

I would also emphasize that immunosuppression can be perpetuated even in the absence of actual antigens. Likely both scenarios coexist. As Naviaux showed, injecting RNA into a pregnant mouse induced autism across all offspring without any infectious component. Many viral infections in ME/CFS are abortive: they generate short RNA fragments that are generally not presented to antigen-presenting cells, yet they still chronically activate PRRs, driving NF-κB, NLRP, and IFNI signaling—each of which alone can induce immune exhaustion. In these cases, no viral protein is produced that could even be presented to T cells.

## TCR is the root trigger

To complete the explanation, I should add that all the molecular mechanisms I described above—including extracellular ATP release and purinergic receptor activation, mTOR upregulation, increased ER stress, the initial activation and subsequent exhaustion of the ISR, activation of both the mitochondrial UPR and the ER UPR, IFN-α synthesis leading to later immunosuppression, and so on—are all downstream of TCR activation. In other words, these mechanisms all stem from continuous cellular activation. They are not merely a collection of independent processes that can also exhaust the cell; every single one originates from the initial activation of a T cell through its TCR upon binding a peptide presented by an antigen-presenting cell. This is a very important point to keep in mind.

This is very important, because when you target one of these downstream pathways of the TCR, you are in fact reducing the signal at the TCR itself and therefore diminishing chronic antigenic stimulation, while at the same time allowing proper activation of the immune cell.

## AHR

in autoimmune diseases the opposite occurs compared to ME/CFS, cancer, and other hypometabolic or chronic infection states. That is, AHR activity is often reduced, and stimulation is usually beneficial, whereas inhibition can be detrimental.

The key lies in the purpose of the AHR: to down-regulate the immune system and restrain excessive pro-inflammatory responses. This can occur either due to xenobiotics entering the body (many of which activate AHR as a compensatory mechanism) or because the immune system is overly activated. This mechanism is highly useful in acute infections, since it is part of the CDR machinery: IDO expression increases, kynurenine (Kyn) rises, AHR is activated, and this serves as a brake.

Therefore, you are right that this is context-dependent. What happens in ME/CFS and in cancer? Undoubtedly, AHR is overactivated. Why? Because IDO is overexpressed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines and also following PRR activation (e.g., TLRs by LPS, viral/bacterial RNA or DNA, etc.). Thus, in chronic infections and inflammation, IDO expression converts Trp into Kyn, the Trp/Kyn ratio decreases, and Kyn overactivates AHR. This is one of the main immunosuppressive pathways, as it raises Tregs, inhibits Teffs, and increases TGF-β.

In this context, you need to restore immunity to fight either cancer or infection. The fear of overshooting and causing autoimmunity, in my opinion, is not supported by the evidence. In animal studies where the immune system is boosted by AHR inhibition, the results show clinical benefit without excessive inflammation or autoimmunity.

Moreover, it is not easy to induce autoimmunity when raising a suppressed immune system. For that, specific antigens need to be presented to APCs in the context of autoimmune disease, which is not occurring in us or in cancer. You would also need to cross the threshold from immunosuppression to an already overactivated immune system — but if you reached that point, you would most likely have already cured ME/CFS or cancer before triggering autoimmunity. Therefore, I truly believe the evidence does not support the idea that inhibiting AHR in cases of immunosuppression would promote autoimmunity.

Regarding Trp and Kyn levels in ME/CFS, it depends on where you look. In the only Long COVID study that measured PBMCs, the result is clear: Trp tends to be low and Kyn high. The same has been shown in ME/CFS. 

In blood, this is harder to detect, as the signal is diluted. Here you must look at the ratio: you may find normal Trp with high Kyn, or normal Kyn with low Trp, but in cancer, ME/CFS, and Long COVID you generally find low Trp and high Kyn — at least in terms of ratio, especially at the intracellular level and in PBMCs, which is where it matters.

I do not rule out that in the very early stages of the disease, when the immune system is highly pro-inflammatory, with low TGF-β and Tregs, and still competent Th1 responses, inhibiting AHR might not be appropriate since full immunosuppression is not yet established. But in our cases, in the majority of cases, with evident immunosuppression, clear CD8 and NK cytotoxicity defects, elevated immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), a dominant Th2 profile (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), and weak Th1 responses (low IFN-γ, IL-12, etc.), I think it is evident that inhibiting AHR is beneficial.

It is much more intelligent to inhibit AHR than to inhibit IDO2. The point is that AHR is not only activated by Kyn, which is formed from Trp catabolism by IDO, but also by many other endogenous ligands. Therefore, you are addressing the problem much more broadly. Moreover, what perpetuates the continuous conversion of Trp into Kyn is IDO itself, which in this context is mainly expressed through AHR activation. Thus, by inhibiting AHR you can break this vicious cycle.

## ALT-803/Anktiva

Specifically, for example, ALT-803 seems absolutely brutal to me. It has effects that I doubt most patients could tolerate, even at low doses. And honestly, I have read all the available trials, and the results are not as impressive as you would expect.

## BCG vaccine

As for Soquelitinib, I’ve read less about it, but I remember going through several studies, and it seems very interesting and with fewer side effects. Problem is that with a single receptor or through only one pathway, you end up overstimulating one part while the rest of the immune system remains exhausted. And that can lead to problems of inefficacy or autoimmunity, etc.

As for the BCG vaccine, I hold a different opinion. What you are really doing is training the immune system. This has been done very successfully, and I believe it is one of our great assets—whether in this case with tuberculosis antigens, or with staphylococcus antigens, as there is also a vaccine that showed very good results, or with antigens from microbes like Borrelia, Bartonella, Babesia, Herpesviruses, etc. This, in my opinion, would indeed be a therapy that creates perfect synergy with all those immune-stimulating treatments that reverse the pathways microbes have tweaked to their advantage.

## Chron's, IBS, and other severe gut treatment

I believe I can give you some very good advice, as I’ve been through something quite terrible and very related. There came a point when I couldn’t eat anything at all. I lost 20 kilos, and at 1.75 meters tall, I dropped to 49 kilos and was in a deplorable state. It’s possible I should have had my colon removed. A CT scan showed no issues, and I decided not to undergo a colonoscopy since it would have caused me to lose another 2 or 3 kilos, which I didn’t want. I tried every type of medication with no effect. So, I studied absolutely all the alternatives in great depth.

I can tell you that a 100% carnivore diet possibly saved my life and undoubtedly spared me from losing my colon. My colon endured a year of chronic diarrhea every single day, followed by two years of complete paralysis where I couldn’t go to the bathroom on my own even once. I had to empty myself every 15 days with a double hydrocolonic therapy.

The symptoms were terrible: dyspepsia, excruciating pain, tremors, cold, gas, colic-like pain, etc.

There are several published studies on complete remissions of ulcerative colitis and possibly Crohn’s disease with a highly ketogenic carnivore diet. There are also very good studies on Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis with non-carnivore ketogenic diets, but I highly recommend you try carnivore.

The transition can be a bit challenging, but I’m willing to help you since I’ve been studying this topic extensively and have lived this first hand.

In terms of treatments, for now, and while transitioning to the appropriate diet, I would recommend Budesonide. It’s a corticosteroid that primarily acts on the gastrointestinal tract and won’t cause the systemic side effects typical of other corticosteroids. Additionally, Mesalazine will help you a lot.

I highly recommend buying GcMAF as it will heal the underlying cause. I'd also consider LDN for the same reason. 

Fortunately, I believe this is a disease that the vast majority of people can cure as long as they maintain the proper diet.

I suggest you watch the videos by Dr. Nick Norowitz, who recently published a case study on a carnivore diet for ulcerative colitis. He cured his ulcerative colitis himself:

https://youtu.be/JJQCwsy_yM8?si=-CztQVMak-DgFRNu

I hope this helps, and I wish you lots of strength through it all.

## Chronic infections

I am aware that in the scientific world of ME/CFS, and therefore in many patients, the prevailing idea is that there are patients with infections and patients without them. But if you study the immune system properly, you know that a depressed immune system always goes hand in hand with chronic infections, because everyone harbors chronic infections, and as soon as the immune system drops, they proliferate. A very clear example is the drop in immunity in HIV or simply by cold exposure or by physical/emotional stress, when you get an HSV-1 or HSV-2 flare, or shingles.

Therefore, if the only way out is to gradually raise the immune system so that it can take charge of the infections—and possibly, if necessary, address these infections with antimicrobials directly—while also dealing with other important aspects such as detoxification, elimination of fermentable gut content, removal of heavy metals, etc., this immune stimulation will have undesirable consequences. Just as the flu has acute symptoms, in severe chronic ME/CFS you will experience worsening in the form of flu-like symptoms, low-grade fever, increased malaise, fatigue, etc. But it is very possible that this is inevitable in order to reach a true cure

The only way to mitigate this effect is to take very small doses and increase them very gradually, even over months or years, until the body slowly tolerates a greater amount of immune stimulation. The same applies to mast cell degranulation: it will be necessary to go slowly and support this process with antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, a low-histamine diet, etc. Thus, in my opinion, I believe the evidence supports that MENK is not especially prone to promote mast cell degranulation, although in a very extreme case it is not inconceivable that at the subcutaneous level there could be some irritation. Systemically, I don’t think this is likely, though the risk is always there. But in addition to this, I would also say that perhaps in general terms it is inevitable to experience some degree of immune activation in order to achieve a definitive cure.

## Knowing CDR stage is important

  
It’s also very important to know which CDR phase you’re in, because if you’re in CDR1 — a highly pro-inflammatory phase — anti-inflammatory therapies might help you move forward into the next phases and eventually out of the CDR, where the cell is repaired and functioning normally. For example, if you’re in CDR1 or CDR2, it makes little sense to take, for example, CoQ10, since the mitochondria won’t use it and you might even worsen your condition. But if you’re already recovering, where your cells might be in CDR3, then you can start to introduce mitochondrial supplements. So, knowing which phase we’re in is extremely useful to build a clinical treatment strategy.

## Is CDR a theory or a proven model?

Okay, I see your point. You’re partly right, but not entirely IMO. For instance, we know perfectly well that macrophages follow this CDR sequence — they show a CDR1 phenotype when activated, shift into CDR2 as they begin to deactivate, and finally reach CDR3 when they return to their M2 phenotype. Likewise, when you stimulate any type of immune cell — including NKs, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and so on — you observe exactly the same pattern, and always in the same order. You can trigger it through extracellular ATP, antigenic stimulation via MHC I or MHC II, LPS exposure via TLR4, OR with other alarmins such as ROS/RNS, interferon-γ, or interferon-α.

Extrapolating this to complex biological systems, we also see the same sequence in virtually any acute infection, like COVID-19 or influenza, as well as in chronic infections such as tuberculosis or HIV. You see a strong inflammatory phenotype early on — fully consistent with what’s expected from CDR1 — followed by an exhaustion phase that clearly corresponds to CDR2.

There are other fascinating examples as well, such as hepatitis C. In the first months and years of infection, hepatocytes clearly meet the criteria for CDR1, and as the disease progresses, they perfectly match the criteria for CDR2. It’s also remarkable that, at a systemic level, the immune system itself mirrors this progression from CDR1 to CDR3.

In the same way, systemic diseases that fall within the CDR2 state — such as pulmonary fibrosis, cancer, or diabetes — show precisely what one would expect: intense cellular proliferation, markedly elevated TGF-β levels driving extensive scar-tissue formation, and tissue overgrowth across different organs depending on the disease. It’s therefore easy to identify conditions that fit within the CDR2 phenotype, because their underlying cellular mechanisms are reflected systemically.

Finally, as you surely know, Naviaux also described how the main signal that transmits perceived danger from one cell to the rest of the body is extracellular ATP. There are hundreds of studies documenting the role of extracellular ATP and how it triggers all kinds of CDR-related phenomena across every possible tissue and disease context. Moreover, there’s experimental evidence — both in animals and in humans — showing that antipurinergic therapies can reverse autism in mice and significantly improve symptoms in children, with one study using a single dose of suramin and another using three doses. That provides direct support for this part of the CDR model proposed by Naviaux.

And we have even more evidence, again highlighting the role of ATP as the key danger signal perpetuating the CDR: when ATP is injected into a mouse, mitochondrial oxygen consumption drops by about 70%. All the expected parameters of acute CDR have been demonstrated by Naviaux in these animal studies and partially reproduced in autistic children with specific measurable biomarkers.

Another cell type where the CDR1 → CDR2 → CDR3 progression is particularly evident — regardless of the lineage you study — is senescent cells. The initial stress drives them into CDR1, with all the hallmark features of that state, and they eventually settle into CDR3, again showing the expected traits of that phase. So yes, there’s still plenty of research to be done, but this is by no means theoretical IMO. We’re talking about a predictable sequence of cellular reactions that can be observed both at the cellular and systemic levels across a wide range of biological systems.

## If CDR is the same across diseases, why are symptoms different?

> I guess the big q is why other chronic infections, or for that matter anything that features the same CDR state that we are in, do not show PEM or other typical ME/CFS symptoms. So if you're saying that other (chronic) diseases are stuck in CDR1/CDR3, there must be more going on **on top** of the cells being stuck in CDR. But actually, you said that any deviation from homeostasis is accounted for by CDR. So rather, what I'm wondering is, which particular pathway is different in ME/CFS vs these other CDR1/CDR3 states that do not feature our symptoms. Because if CDR describes the commonalities among all chronic disease states, I am personally rather interested in the **differences** between these disease states, ie what makes ME/CFS ME/CFS. Eg I imagine reverse electorn transfer is a universal response whenever the ETC is inhibited, so there has to be more going on during PEM in ME/CFS.

 > My guess would be that it depends on the cell types affected, and the composition of pathways that can stay chronically active according to CDR, which is very likely dfiferent for all diessses.

You’re asking truly excellent questions — and I completely agree that these are the key issues to examine when approaching our illness through the lens of the Cell Danger Response (CDR).

Of course, the symptoms of any given disease depend on which cells are affected and on the state of the immune system. If the immune system is in a strongly pro-inflammatory phase, it may drive autoimmunity, whereas if it’s in an exhausted state, it tends to result in chronic infection with low-grade inflammation. The initial trigger is equally important: different “master” infections — such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella, or Babesia — can produce distinct clinical pictures depending not only on the pathogen but also on the tissues they inhabit. For example, Borrelia in the heart can lead to pericarditis; in the CNS it has been associated with Alzheimer’s-like pathology; and when it predominates in muscle and connective tissue, it often manifests as migratory pain or fibromyalgia-type symptoms.

It’s also crucial to consider cases in which pathogenic autoantibodies are clearly involved and cause characteristic tissue inflammation, as described in the recent paper on interferon-γ and low-affinity antibodies — a mechanism that does not seem to occur in ME/CFS. In such diseases, the origin of those antibodies matters enormously. Often it’s molecular mimicry to infectious antigens; in other cases, it arises from immune reactivity to gut-derived food antigens or to GAD peptides. This could explain why some people with multiple sclerosis experience total remission on a strict carnivore diet yet relapse once they reintroduce common foods.

Your question about why such similar immune signatures can underlie very different diseases is an excellent one. If you compare the immune profiles of patients with long-term HIV, tuberculosis, or chronic hepatitis, you’ll see the same pattern: a blunted Th1 response, elevated anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β1, poor NK cytotoxicity, macrophage and dendritic-cell anergy, and persistent low-grade inflammation. The difference lies mainly in tissue tropism — in hepatitis the liver bears the brunt, in HIV the immune system and CNS are heavily affected, and in tuberculosis the lungs are the primary target — but systemically, immune exhaustion looks remarkably similar across them all.

We might speculate that in ME/CFS, Borrelia burgdorferi infection (present, I suspect, in nearly all patients) plays a major role. Yet why some individuals develop neurological or migratory-pain syndromes while others fall into a profound fatigue state remains unexplained.

What we do know is that in ME/CFS the immune dysfunction mirrors that seen in chronic infections and even in cancer: infected or transformed cells both drive immunosuppressive signals that culminate in immune exhaustion. At the cellular level, immune cells lose their ability to produce ATP — and once that happens across many cell types, systemic fatigue and metabolic dysregulation are inevitable.

Any cell exposed to sustained stress — whether immune or tissue — follows the same sequence: initial pro-inflammatory activation (CDR phase 1), then, if the stress persists, metabolic downregulation with suppressed glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. These hypometabolic cells are essentially the cellular correlate of systemic CDR persistence in ME/CFS. Numerous chronic post-infectious conditions converge on this same hypometabolic phenotype — what Naviaux grouped under CDR type A — including ME/CFS and Long COVID.

Given this, independent of the specific infection involved, there must be genetic predispositions that influence which disease phenotype emerges under chronic inflammatory stress. Some people with Lyme develop localized neurological, muscular, or cardiac syndromes without systemic hypometabolism, while others progress straight into a hypometabolic, fatigue-dominant state. We don’t yet understand why, but this is a key question for future study.

Extracellular ATP, as Naviaux demonstrated, is perhaps the strongest “danger signal” known. Injecting ATP into mice suppresses mitochondrial respiration by roughly 70%, directly inducing a hypometabolic state. Similarly, in immune cells, incremental ATP exposure first activates them, then over-activates, and finally drives apoptosis or exhaustion. This same signaling logic applies system-wide.

Interestingly, antipurinergic interventions seem to help across the entire CDR spectrum — whether the disease is autoimmune and pro-inflammatory (like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), oncologic, or infectious with immune suppression— tending to restore homeostasis. The same principle holds for drugs like rapamycin, which normalizes immune tone in either direction — stimulating when suppressed, calming when overactive. The same could be said for JHU compounds that modulate glutamine metabolism, for MENK— LDN shows this bidirectional homeostatic effect across autoimmunity, cancer, and chronic infection—, for ISR activation, for  VDR agonism,  possibly for IRG1 inhibition, for any therapy that oxidizes NADH into NAD+, etc. (perhaps this is not true for AHR that depends on the CDR status). 

So, while we don’t yet know precisely which cells are primarily affected or why some individuals develop a hypometabolic phenotype while others develop localized tissue inflammation, we do know that the therapeutic goal must be restoration of homeostasis — by reducing the false “danger” signals that perpetuate the CDR. The main drivers of these alarm signals are chronic infections, toxins, nutrient deficiencies, and self-reinforcing positive feedback loops that sustain sterile inflammation.

Among exogenous triggers, the most impactful are likely mycotoxins from water-damaged buildings, tick-borne and vector-borne pathogens (transmitted also by mosquitoes or fleas), heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and chronic oral sources such as root canals or cavitations.
Each individual may have additional idiosyncratic exposures.

Another very important self-perpetuating cycle is the fermenting gut, which needs to be addressed as well IMO.

## Targeting all infections or not

As for internal infections, many of us harbor over a dozen latent or persistent microbes when tested deeply. It’s impractical and counterproductive to attack them all with endless antimicrobials; without immune restoration, these treatments fail — explaining why long-term antibiotic courses rarely eradicate Borrelia or co-infections in immunosuppressed patients.

A more logical strategy is twofold:

(1) Reduce avoidable exposures — for example, chelating heavy metals, supporting detoxification through saunas, Epsom-salt baths, MSM, or phosphatidylcholine infusions — and
(2) Target the shared CDR pathways that restore immune competence, allowing the body itself gradually to regain control of chronic infections, potentially complemented by individualized antimicrobials.

If that’s insufficient, additional layers might involve breaking sterile self-perpetuating cycles with agents like filgotinib, daratumumab, or ixazomib, or neuromodulatory approaches such as transcranial ultrasound or electromagnetic stimulation to calm limbic-system hypervigilance. Peptides and therapies that rebalance CRFR2 and serotonergic tone, and even, —and much to my regret— neurocognitive retraining programs like Gupta or DNRS (for those stable enough to perform them), can be helpful — conceptually similar to phantom-limb rehabilitation, retraining the brain to stop perpetuating maladaptive feedback loops.

## Interventions depend on CDR stage

In response to your question: If the CDR truly encompasses all the cellular defense mechanisms that can be activated under any type of stress, then what specific insight or explanatory value does it actually offer us?

First of all, Naviaux discovered that there is a universal order that cells must follow to repair themselves and eliminate stress. If this is not possible, they enter apoptosis, thereby removing the damaged element from the organism.

Secondly, he classified diseases according to the estimated percentage of cells trapped in each of the three CDR stages, which is incredibly useful.
For example, acute diseases such as acute infections fall under CDR1, where the innate immune response predominates. When the damage is severe, cells can undergo apoptosis or even necrosis. At the cellular level, we see increased cytoplasmic anaerobic respiration and reduced mitochondrial oxidative respiration. This phase is characterized by elevated ROS, inflammasome activation (NLRP3) leading to IL-1β and IL-18 release, and upregulation of SAMe and the transsulfuration pathway to produce GSH.

In CDR2, the predominant features are cell proliferation and fibrosis, as seen in cancer, diabetes, and similar conditions. Fibrotic and granulomatous processes are common, and when the damage is excessive, cells can enter senescence.

Finally, in CDR3, cells begin to recover mitochondrial respiration and re-establish connections with neighboring cells, much like the late phase of wound healing. However, in chronic disease, when cells remain stuck in this phase, we find a state of cellular exhaustion in which both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration are depressed, inflammation is low, lactate may be reduced, and overall cellular anergy predominates.

From this framework, many things can be inferred: For instance, anti-inflammatory drugs are more likely to work during CDR1, but not in CDR3. Likewise, mitochondrial supplements often fail in CDR3A (the subtype that includes ME/CFS or Long COVID), because when the mitochondria are shut down, adding cofactors is useless or even counterproductive.
Similarly, in CDR2, it makes little sense to give anabolic hormones, as this could worsen cancer or other proliferative states.

These are just basic examples showing that, depending on the CDR phase, some interventions may help while others may harm—and that already has major therapeutic implications.

## Mitochondria are not damaged

Another crucial point in Naviaux’s work is his demonstration that the mitochondria themselves are not structurally damaged. The problem is not a mechanical failure but a metabolic signaling state. According to him, the main danger signal is extracellular ATP, though other molecules—certain immunoglobulins, mtDNA, succinate, IFN-α, or TGF-β1—can also play similar roles IMO. 

Naviaux also showed that in autistic mouse models, administration of suramin reversed all metabolic abnormalities: neurological deficits, gut microbiome changes, methylation defects, and even mitochondrial function. This demonstrates that the pathology is driven by aberrant mitochondrial signaling, not by irreversible cellular or tissue damage.

## Why do individual treatments not work?

Now, how does all this translate to ME/CFS?

For many years I understood the anomalies seen in this disease and the treatments proposed, but I couldn’t connect them.
I knew about infections like Lyme, viral reactivations, heavy metals, elevated RNase-L, NK cell dysfunction, mitochondrial inefficiency, POTS, low GSH, high ROS/RNA or methylation cycle deficits. Yet none of the targeted treatments—methylation support, antivirals, antibiotics, probiotics or mitochondrial therapies—produced significant or lasting improvement.

Now I understand why: The methylation block is secondary to the oxidative state that arises when mitochondria stop using oxygen to recycle ATP. Thus, it follows the mitochondrial shutdown. If the mitochondria are closed, mitochondrial supplements won’t work. And if detoxification and immune capacity are weak, even mild detox attempts can worsen symptoms—as happened to me.
If immune cells themselves are stuck in a CDR, they are metabolically exhausted, so antimicrobials will fail simply because an effective immune response is missing.

Recognizing that this is a signaling disorder shifts the focus to identifying everything that might be sending danger signals—toxins, radiation, mycotoxins, infections (Borrelia, Babesia, herpesviruses), and so on.

After long-term illness, structural conditions such as EDS or CCI may also develop. Although probably secondary to a chronic CDR, they too emit persistent danger signals and often require direct interventions, even surgery.

Dietary antigens are another major source of exogenous danger signals.
Therefore, the diet must be cleaned of all potential allergens—gluten, casein/caseomorphins, lectins, oxalates, etc.—and gut fermentation must be reduced to prevent the entry of LPS, ammonia, D-lactate, alcohols, and other metabolites that inhibit mitochondria and chronically activate innate immunity.

Because we are in a hypometabolic CDR, the immune system becomes exhausted and can no longer control latent infections, which then become endogenous sources of danger. The solution isn’t merely antimicrobials (which fail without immune competence) but to lift immune cells out of the CDR.

## How to study CDR?

To study this, we can look for simple, observable models that scale to systemic behavior. We know that the primary trigger of the CDR is extracellular ATP. Interestingly, low doses of ATP can stimulate immunity, while high doses overstimulate it and lead to apoptosis or immune exhaustion.

This can be modeled in vitro in any immune cell type—by continuous LPS stimulation via TLRs, antigenic stimulation of T cells via TCR, or NK receptor activation. Immune cells go through the same three CDR-like phases: initial pro-inflammatory activation (CDR1), proliferation and senescence (CDR2), and finally immune exhaustion (CDR3).

By studying how immune exhaustion develops, and which pathways are engaged during the early CDR1 activation that ultimately cause it, we can identify the molecular targets needed to reverse it. Here we find critical roles for purinergic signaling, mTOR, ISR, Nagalase, TGF-β1, PGE2, GDF15, VDR inhibition by microbes, mtDNA release after calcium enters the mitochondria, IFN-α/JAK1/ACOD1/itaconate, interferon-stimulated genes that promotes immune-supressive molecules like arginase, PD-1, CTLA-4, or SOCS, glutamine metabolism in infected cells, GSK-3β, mitochondrial reductive stress (high NADH/NAD⁺), acetyl-CoA depletion by itaconate and PDH inhibition, excess flux through the PPP causing BH4/BH2 imbalance causing NOS uncoupling and a shift from NO to ROS production. Moreover, excess NADPH from the PPP drives additional ROS formation via NOX enzymes.

All these events follow a specific sequence that reproduces itself consistently during immune exhaustion.
When these pathways are experimentally targeted one by one in vitro, immune function can be restored. Similarly in in vivo models of chronic infection or cancer, blocking purinergic signaling, inhibiting glutamine metabolism, suppressing mTOR, or activating the ISR all normalize immune function and reverse disease.

Hence, we already have a clear roadmap of molecular targets capable of reversing the main alarm signals that keep the organism locked in the disease state.

## Complications in long-term illness

In a complex human system after many years of illness, of course, things get much more complicated. As @c  pointed out, there are privileged niches inaccessible to immune cells, where infections can persist. Pathogens form biofilms that also prevent immune access. And even without active infection, inflammatory signals and autoreactive antibodies or T cells can perpetuate the process.
There is also a neurological memory of disease—demonstrated in animal models—where mere neuronal activation can reproduce sickness behavior and hypometabolism even in the absence of infection.

The limbic system itself, upon receiving systemic inflammatory signals—either directly or through the vagus nerve—induces what is known as sickness behavior, possibly mediated by CRFR2 receptors and an excess of serotonergic tone.

Over time, we accumulate toxins and dormant infections that must be cleared. Multiple sterile feedback loops—alarmins, gut-derived LPS, extracellular ATP, reactive oxygen species, mtDNA, succinate, fibronectin fragments—all reinforce the chronic “disease homeostasis.”

Yet, across diverse models—HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, numerous cancers—inhibition of purinergic signaling, or addressing some of the pathways I described above, consistently reactivates immunity and eliminates disease, regardless of the tissue or symptoms.
Therefore, it seems a reasonable inference that the same could apply to us.

By extending Naviaux’s CDR framework to the immune system and our own pathophysiology, we finally have a coherent mechanistic model—and a therapeutic roadmap that, if targeted correctly, I hope could restore normal homeostasis again.

## Temporary remissions

you’ll notice that for most of my 20 years of illness I knew a lot of the parts of the ME/CFS pathophysiology but couldn’t connect the dots until about three years ago, when I carried out the research described in that same message. 

That work led me to develop my current theory, which I haven’t yet been able to put fully into practice: Initially, both my partner and I focused solely on taking antipurinergic compounds for 1.5 years, and we realized it really seemed to be the right path — the immune system improved greatly, many lab parameters normalized, and both of us tested negative for Lyme after 10 and 20 years of unsuccessful treatments. However, it wasn’t enough to fully reverse the immunosuppression or produce substantial clinical recovery, so I expanded my theory to include other pathways and potential treatments.

At my current stage, I cannot tolerate most treatments because I developed a kind of chronic vasovagal syndrome after a duodenal ulcer I caused myself. We also believe that the GcMAF, which once helped me so much, is essential to establish a foundation from which all other therapies can work better. We’re waiting until we can produce the proper GcMAF again and see it function as it once did before introducing the other therapies.

In any case, in the past—before I had the current level of understanding that allows me to connect most of the pieces—I did focus on strengthening the immune system, since it made sense given the infections and immune deficiencies, and I achieved very good results with LDN and GcMAF. I improved from being 99% bedridden to the point where I could go back to the gym, drive, and attend university again. I didn’t fully recover, but I reached a high level of improvement that I later lost when GcMAF was no longer available. That experience made me realize that supporting the immune system was essential, because it resolved all my gut problems and many other symptoms that had seemed completely unrelated to immunity — such as severe cognitive impairment, word-finding difficulties, inability to follow conversations, or brain fog — and it even allowed me to regain weight after seven years in a highly catabolic state and being significantly underweight.

Later, in medical school, while studying microbiology, I learned that Lyme disease, specifically Borrelia, does not directly cause symptoms; rather, it’s the immune system itself that produces them, driven by bacterial immune-modulation. That insight led me to study low-dose antigen therapies in depth, and eventually I went to the United States to obtain LDI (Low Dose Immune Therapy). This treatment managed to fully cure and render my mother asymptomatic for several years, greatly improved my partner — who went from being bedridden to going out dancing and seeing her friends — and twice gave me the most dramatic improvement I’ve ever experienced in twenty years.

Unfortunately, those effects gradually faded, and we were never able to stabilize the therapy, but it provided another key realization: the core problem lies in the immune system and its regulatory signaling. Seeing both my mother and my partner recover overnight — from being bedridden to going out without fatigue, pain, MCS or brain fog — confirmed that this is a signaling problem, not structural damage.

## Precise flow

So, I started by digging into Naviaux’s papers, where he explains how the Cell Danger Response encompasses several well-known biological processes such as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), the Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (mtUPR), the chaperone response, etc. I decided to study these pathways in detail and how they’re linked to microbes — how microbes activate them to their own advantage and to immunosuppress us — and then how all these stress pathways interconnect. As I started putting the pieces together, I realized there were always a few key components. Extracellular ATP was always present; purinergic receptors were essential to initiate the cascade; and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) triggered by microbial components also set everything in motion. Then, once you look at how mitochondria fit into these processes — and how immune exhaustion itself is connected to mitochondrial dysfunction — everything starts to make sense.

If you study the most obvious example, like how a macrophage or a T lymphocyte gets activated, you see that activation requires a massive amount of protein synthesis to produce cytokines and effector molecules. This causes endoplasmic reticulum stress, because the ER becomes overloaded folding those proteins. As a result, the UPR is activated to trigger the ISR, which in turn induces antioxidant programs to counteract the surge of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increases protease and chaperone activity to assist protein folding, and decreases the synthesis of non-essential proteins. In infected non-immune cells, this downregulation of host protein synthesis helps prevent microbes from hijacking the host’s RNA to make their own proteins.

Naturally, all this requires enormous amounts of energy, which is where mTOR comes in — mobilizing resources for both glucose and fatty acid oxidation. The mitochondria must run at maximum capacity, so extracellular ATP activates purinergic receptors, allowing calcium to flood into the cytosol, then into the ER, and subsequently into the mitochondria. Initially, this boosts oxidative phosphorylation, increases ATP output, and strongly polarizes the mitochondrial membrane. All these processes are necessary for immune activation — but if the activation is prolonged, that’s when problems begin. The mitochondria start to stall; excess ROS accumulates; mTOR and ROS both inhibit mitochondrial function; peroxynitrite, nitric oxide, and TGF-β1 further suppress it, creating even more oxidative stress. This upregulates NOX enzymes, producing still more ROS. As the mitochondria fail, reductive stress builds up — excess electrons react with oxygen that’s no longer properly reduced, generating additional radicals. This keeps the UPR, mtUPR, and ISR chronically active until they collapse: the ISR becomes exhausted, the UPR overflows, and more calcium and ROS are dumped into the mitochondria, worsening the damage.

We could go on — purinergic signaling also directly activates mTOR and interferon genes, which over time leads to immunosuppression and production of itaconate, a metabolite that’s initially pro-inflammatory but later inhibits the Krebs cycle and acts as a strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive signal. I’m recalling all this from memory, and there are many more pathways and steps involved, but the main idea is that the same machinery that fuels energy production and protein synthesis during immune activation will eventually cause immune exhaustion if it stays on too long. These programs evolved for acute infections, not chronic ones — so what saves you in the short term acting as breaks of the excessuve inflammation, becomes immunosuppressive in the long term. And microbes take advantage of that. They actively modulate these pathways to push the system toward this suppressed, chronic state.

## Commonalities between stages

So you’re absolutely right: any of these elements, when you look at them in context, behave similarly regardless of whether you’re in a pro-inflammatory (CDR1) or an anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressed (CDR3) state. For instance, mTOR tends to be elevated both in inflammatory and in immunosuppressive diseases. So lowering it relieves mitochondrial inhibition and ER stress — what can either decrease inflammation or, paradoxically, restore it if that’s what’s needed. Similarly, blocking purinergic signaling improves a wide range of inflammatory conditions — autoimmune diseases, autism, Alzheimer’s — while in infections  (acute or chronic) and cancer, it can enhance immune function and mitochondrial efficiency, regardless of the CDR phase. The only exception might be the AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) pathway, which I haven’t explored in depth yet in pro-inflammatory conditions. In autoimmune diseases, AHR expression actually seems to be reduced, which might make this axis unique in that it's state depends on the CDR phenotype.

## Unknowns

We’ll likely find other relevant targets within the CDR framework — for example, the calcium channels that regulate mitochondrial calcium influx or the pores that release mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm. I’m not sure yet if those are central in cases of deep immunosuppression, but I suspect they might be. 

What’s hardest, in my view, is finding therapies that truly work. For instance, in one ex vivo study on ME/CFS, salubrinal (which acts like Sephin-1) completely restored mitochondrial function. Yet in practice, Sephin-1 only slightly helps some patients. I don’t think that means the pathway is unimportant — I think the drug just isn’t potent enough. The same applies to antipurinergic drugs — we probably need suramin or similar compounds, and for extended periods. Or probably, we need sinergy of multiple pathways at once, and side effects/interactions here might be an issue. 

The area I’ve studied least — and where I think the next big breakthroughs might come — is the limbic system and amygdala involvement. In mice, for example, if you activate the same neurons that are triggered during intestinal infection, you can reproduce the entire illness in healthy animals. That tells us there’s a neural memory perpetuating the disease — the so-called sickness behavior. It’s obvious, because a person with moderate ME/CFS who takes amphetamines suddenly feels completely normal; you’re basically tricking the brain out of the sickness program. The hypothesis behind the CT38 project was fascinating — inhibiting CRFR2 to lower serotonergic tone in the brainstem might be one piece of that puzzle. I don’t know if it’s the whole story, but it’s an area that still has a lot to reveal.

Lastly, I think immune training could be crucial. Vaccines like BCG or staphylococcal vaccines have shown promising results. I’ve already mentioned my own experience — and that of my mother and partner — with homeopathic dilutions of tick-borne bacterial antigens. There are also remarkable studies using sublingual hepatitis antigens, showing full recovery and restoration of immune homeostasis. So I believe potential therapies could include real sublingual antigens for common chronic viruses like cytomegalovirus, HHV-6, and Epstein-Barr, as well as components like mycolic acid, which likely explains part of why the BCG vaccine works so well.

So yeah, still a lot to research, learn and try!! :)! 


PS. By the way, regarding nagalase, there’s very little research available, and so far I haven’t been able to find any evidence showing that infected or exhausted cells actually synthesize and release nagalase from their membranes. Still, I think this is a very real possibility, and if confirmed, it would directly link nagalase activity to the CDR. 

What is known, though, is that all microbes analyzed so far—viruses, bacteria, and even some fungi—express and release nagalase, which is one of the most potent immunosuppressive enzymes identified. It blocks the immune response right at its initiation point, acting on dendritic cells and macrophages, essentially cutting off antigen presentation and adaptive activation.

As for opioid receptors, I still haven’t found a clear explanation for why their activity decreases during the CDR. What I do know, for instance, is that when methionine levels drop—due to reduced organic sulfur flow through the methylation cycle caused by deficiencies in active vitamins B12 and B9—the synthesis of 5-methionine enkephalin (MENK) from phosphatidylethanolamine is reduced. So it makes sense that we produce less MENK

But we also have fewer beta-endorphins... This might be linked to the instability of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) when BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin) is depleted—both because of methylation defects and because peroxynitrite oxidizes BH4. There must be a fixed mechanistic link there somewhere; I’m sure of it.

Another thing I forgot to mention: if you want to identify which pathways are disrupted in ME/CFS within the hypometabolic phenotype, it’s extremely useful to study the metabolic pathways that drive and sustain cellular senescence. Most of them are the very same ones that are dysregulated in ME/CFS — it’s honestly quite remarkable.


## Neurotransmitters

For example, the neurotransmitter imbalance may stem from NOS uncoupling. When NOS becomes uncoupled, it produces superoxide instead of nitric oxide, which then reacts with any remaining nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite, in turn, oxidizes BH4 and further inhibits NOS. Meanwhile, activation of the pentose phosphate pathway increases NADPH, which fuels NOX activity, generating more superoxide — further perpetuating NOS uncoupling. Excess oxidative stress also disrupts the methylation cycle, leading to a shortage of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is needed to regenerate BH4. Without enough BH4, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine synthesis all decline.

But ultimately, trying to fix these individual pathways one by one is futile — everything realigns when you address the primary cause.

## S's evaluation of me, part 1: OAT

I’ve reviewed your organic acids test, and it’s quite interesting. You show deficiencies in both the serotonin and dopamine pathways. This usually stems from two factors. First, if you look at the pathway, both serotonin and dopamine, derived from tryptophan and phenylalanine, require BH4 for synthesis. The problem is that we often have impaired BH4 availability, since it depends on adequate methylation to generate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which stabilizes BH4 and also supports iNOS. That way, BH4 can activate iNOS properly instead of generating excess superoxide and peroxynitrite. The lack of methylation usually occurs under conditions of oxidative stress inside the cell, typically when there is mitochondrial dysfunction and when the CDR is active. In other words, it is a consequence of oxidative stress, intrinsic to the CDR.

What can be done in the meantime is to support methylation with SAMe, together with methylated B9 and B12 in the form of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and sublingual or SC or IM hydroxocobalamin or methylcobalamin. This can help improve methylation and possibly normalize serotonin and dopamine levels, although it’s not a magic solution; as long as the disease is active, this impairment will persist. But many patients feels the difference. 

Another reason serotonin and its metabolites decrease is that tryptophan is diverted through the enzyme IDO, which is strongly induced by proinflammatory cytokines. IDO converts tryptophan into kynurenine, which activates AHR and induces TGF-β1, IL-6, and further IDO expression, perpetuating the cycle. This kynurenine/AHR axis is one of the major immunosuppressive pathways, and it also drives the expression of enzymes such as CD38 and PPAR that consume NAD⁺, further reducing mitochondrial function and favoring reductive stress. This is where TMS, by inhibiting AHR, could be very helpful.

On the other hand, the organic acids pattern suggests that the itaconate shunt is active, as indicated by a high succinate-to-fumarate ratio. This is consistent with itaconate inhibiting the conversion of succinate to fumarate. Interestingly, fumarate is still within normal or even elevated range.

Meanwhile, your antioxidant capacity appears to be under strain, as indicated by elevated pyroglutamate, which reflects an attempt to produce glutathione. This suggests that glutathione itself is likely low, NAC is depleted, even though vitamin C remains normal. Early in the disease, during a more proinflammatory CDR1 state, fumarate can still accept electrons and be reduced back to succinate in an attempt to preserve NAD⁺ levels. Over time this compensation fails, and fumarate levels typically collapse toward zero. This pattern suggests you are still in a predominantly proinflammatory state.

This also fits with evidence of increased transsulfuration flux toward glutathione production. That’s why some of your sulfur-related metabolite
(2-hydroxybutyric acid) is very high. Interestingly, your methylmalonic acid is not elevated, which is unusual if there is functional B12 deficiency. This may mean you are supplementing B12; if not, then you have not yet reached the point of methylmalonate accumulation. It would have been very useful to see FIGLU (formiminoglutamate) as a marker of active folate status. Both active B12 and B9 are required to sustain the methylation cycle and recycle homocysteine to methionine. Have you checked homocysteine in blood? If it is elevated, you should lower it with active B12 and B9 as described.

Most amino acid metabolites are very low except for hydroxybutyrate. This could reflect NAD⁺ or B2 deficiency. If low aminoacids are confirmed in plasma or urine, you might benefit from broad amino acid supplementation (e.g. complete amino acid mixes) or simply higher dietary protein. However, due to low stomach acid, intestinal dysbiosis, and intrinsic catabolism, many patients are unable to raise amino acid levels significantly, even with increased protein in the diet—hence the AAs are a good alternative. 

Are you currently in ketosis? Please confirm, as otherwise it would be very surprising to see specific ketosis markers.

You also show elevated arabinose, consistent with Candida albicans, and some metabolites that may indicate Clostridium difficile. In my opinion these findings are common and not very actionable. Treating Candida usually doesn’t solve much. You could reduce carbohydrates or follow a ketogenic diet to try to starve them, but until immune function recovers, dysbiosis will not resolve properly. That has been my experience and that of many other patients.

In conclusion, I see relatively common abnormalities, but the fumarate pattern suggests you are still in an early inflammatory stage of the illness with typical abnormalities 

You are right that elevated suberic acid implies omega-oxidation, and this is actually to be expected since fatty acid oxidation requires NAD⁺ to be reduced to NADH. When there is mitochondrial reductive stress, this cannot occur. The problem is that pyruvate dehydrogenase is also inhibited, so glucose oxidation, its conversion into acetyl-CoA, and subsequent entry into the Krebs cycle are also deficient. Therefore, in my view, this tends to be more of a mitochondrial dysfunction than a purely genetic or epigenetic defect of fatty acid oxidation.

Next, the fact that you felt better after your first fast, or that you improved with MCTs—which indeed produce ketones very rapidly—is an indication that ketosis may benefit you. As you surely know, high ketosis is one of the most powerful therapies to reduce neuroglial inflammation, increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor, lower mitochondrial inflammation, reduce central nervous system inflammation, decrease glutamate, increase GABA, and overall produce fewer ROS, among other effects.

Therefore, if you can tolerate a ketogenic diet, I believe it could be beneficial given that your main symptoms are neurological. But if not, I would definitely try exogenous ketones in the form of salts rather than esters, and see how you do. I would test both sodium-based and magnesium-based versions, as well as potassium-based, so you can combine them and take a fairly high total dose—especially using sodium β-hydroxybutyrate, which allows for a higher daily intake.

## S's evaluation of me, part 2

I’ve reviewed everything you sent me. I still can’t open the clinical history file, but even without that, the overall picture is very clear. Serum cytokines, when elevated, are extremely informative because they show that systemic inflammation is not just present but significantly activated. In your case, the Th2-skewed profile is unmistakable: IL-4, IL-13, and elevated total IgE all point in the same direction. The high mycotoxin load in urine—on two separate tests—and the presence of fungal organisms in nasal and sinus secretions provide a strong and continuous antigenic stimulus that pushes the immune system toward this Th2/ILC2-dominant state.

High RANTES (CCL5) and elevated IL-8 indicate substantial systemic inflammation, combining lymphocytic and neutrophilic recruitment signals. Together with leptin—which, in this context, behaves as a pro-inflammatory adipokine that recruits monocytes and T cells—this suggests that both the innate and adaptive arms are being “called” into action. The problem is that their functional capacity is impaired. Activated T cells (CD3⁺HLA-DR⁺) are very low, reflecting suppression of the adaptive effector response, while NK cells are numerically high but functionally depleted—a classic sign of chronic immune stimulation leading to exhaustion.

Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt also notes that elevated RANTES is very often a marker of retroviral activation. I would be very interested to know whether your nagalase levels are high in other tests, because I don’t fully trust the Amatica measurements. In any case, when we are in this state of chronic CDR activation and inflammation, global methylation capacity decreases, which increases the expression of endogenous retroviruses—and these can contribute to the broader inflammatory context. Obviously, improving one part of the system helps the others, but if you are interested in looking into Dr. Klinghardt’s specific protocols for retroviral activation, based on certain herbal combinations, this is another angle worth considering. And yes, this would also imply finding a reliable source of GcMAF.

Ferritin is high, which, as an acute-phase reactant, fits perfectly with a state of sustained systemic inflammation. The fact that ceruloplasmin is at the lower end of normal suggests suboptimal copper availability and impaired ferroxidase activity—this allows iron to remain intracellular, promoting oxidative stress and even ferroptosis under certain conditions. This is a well-described host strategy against chronic infections: iron sequestration helps limit microbial access to iron but comes at the cost of cellular stress.

Elevated lipase and amylase, in this context, most likely represent low-grade chronic pancreatic inflammation, not an acute pancreatitis. Given your coexisting microvascular dysfunction (VEGF extremely high, Long COVID background, and the possibility of Bartonella), endothelial injury within the pancreatic microcirculation is a very plausible contributor.

Your thyroid profile suggests early Graves’ disease: TSH is already on the low side, and both T3 and T4 are drifting toward the upper end of normal. I strongly recommend testing for TSI, TRAb (TSHR-stimulating antibodies), TPOAb, and TgAb. Treating hyperthyroidism—if confirmed—would likely help you by reducing the extreme sympathetic surges you’ve been experiencing. Hyperthyroidism accelerates mitochondrial biogenesis and forces both lipids and glucose into the cell, increasing the reductive and oxidative stress load on mitochondria and the cytoplasm. Correcting this would remove a major pro-inflammatory driver.

Interestingly, your DHEA-S is still normal, which means your adrenal reserve remains intact. Over time, it is often one of the first hormones to decline in chronic inflammatory and infectious syndromes, so maintaining normal levels at this stage is reassuring.

Regarding the Amatica DRP1 result, I would be cautious in over-interpreting it. But if it is accurate and truly reflects reduced DRP1 expression inside cells, then it suggests a mitochondrial fragmentation defect with a bias toward hyperfusion. This actually makes sense. In early CDR1, mitochondria undergo defensive hyperfision; but as immune cells become progressively dysfunctional, they can remain locked in a hyperfused, low-turnover state characteristic of chronic CDR3A physiology. In real life this is never binary—some cells still attempt activation and maintain high fusion, while others are exhausted and remain hyperfused, which is equally detrimental.

Overall, your immune profile is typical of someone early in the evolution of a chronic illness, where CDR1-type inflammatory activation coexists with the early stages of CDR3-type exhaustion. The NK data show this perfectly: increased numbers reflect strong inflammatory signalling and recruitment, but low cytotoxic function shows exhaustion, not competence.

Long COVID alone can produce significant vascular involvement, often accompanied by elevated VEGF. However, in your specific case—and based on your symptoms—the possibility of Bartonella is very real. This relationship is well described in the literature; microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD., has discussed these patterns extensively in Long COVID cohorts.

As you know from my general view of ME/CFS and Long COVID, CDR dysregulation is driven primarily by persistent infections and environmental toxins. Your strong Borrelia IgG (ELISA + Western Blot), combined with NK dysfunction, suggests that Borrelia is very likely part of the picture. And where Borrelia is present, co-infections such as Bartonella or Babesia are common. On top of this, your mycotoxin levels are extremely high—among the highest I have ever seen—indicating significant past or ongoing mold exposure. Addressing and eliminating this toxic load at home and inside the body is essential.

To be fully transparent with you: if I were in your position and had the means, I would seek care from a U.S. physician highly experienced in this cluster of conditions. Neil Nathan, for example, or Jill Crista, are internationally recognized for their expertise in mold toxicity and vector-borne infections. Their guidance could make a substantial difference. I haven’t pursued care with them myself for two reasons: financial limitations, and because my own illness phenotype is entirely different from yours. My case is dominated by mental and physical fatigue and severe gastrointestinal dysfunction, with borderline or weak infectious markers, low inflammation, and profound immunosuppression—very different from your clearly inflammatory, infectious, and toxin-driven presentation. Experts like Nathan or Crista could likely help you much more than they could help me.

You clearly have abnormalities at multiple levels: endocrine, neurological, immunological, neuroinflammatory, serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic... But after 21 years sick, and after interacting with many patients, I can tell you that targeting individual biochemical abnormalities rarely produces meaningful improvements. The therapies I mentioned previously may help you symptomatically, but none of them replace the fundamental need to treat the root causes: clearing the mycotoxins, treating Bartonella and Lyme, and reducing the overall pathogen and toxin burden.

The good news is that you caught this early. You can still see the drivers clearly in your lab tests, which means the treatments can be much more effective. In my case, after so many years, the system may simply be self-propagating. But in your case, with the right clinician and the right strategy, I really believe you have a strong chance of improving.

If I were you, I would get under the care of someone who truly understands mold toxicity and vector-borne diseases in depth. That is where your best chances lie—and of course improve that treatment with the therapies we have access to on MM, that they can't apply they don't know. 


The “poisoned feeling” you get when PEM kicks in is most likely your brain’s interpretation of a neuro-immune flare, not actual toxins flowing around. After exertion, the innate immune system in ME/CFS/long-COVID tends to overreact, releasing inflammatory molecules and oxidative stress that activate glial cells in the brain and spinal cord.

The upper cervical region and brainstem are key hubs where vagus, pain pathways and meningeal/lymphatic drainage all converge. When this area becomes inflamed and overloaded with immune signals, your nervous system can map that activity as a wave of “toxic sludge” rising from the nape into the head. It’s a very real signal, but it’s about neuroinflammation and autonomic dysregulation, not literal poison in your cerebrospinal fluid.

[regarding the theory on complex IV breakage due to localized hypoxia]

Yeah, that might be the case, but electrons that will leak from the 3rd complex will also leak from the first... So I don't know.

Your symptoms are familiar to me and are related to Bartonella, Babesia, and mold. I have known many fellows describing this. 

You can read the compilation of symptoms described by Dr Horowitz attributed to each infection, and also Dr Nathan's last book (Toxic, second edition), describing this.

I think in your case SARS-CoV-2 activated one of these infections as have been published several times.

I can send you Dr. Richard Horowitz’s latest book, where—if I remember correctly—he describes the characteristic symptoms of each infection, and it’s quite interesting. You’ll definitely recognize the symptoms you’ve been describing. I wouldn’t rule out mold either, since it can also present with those symptoms, although the fact that they come and go points more toward these bacterial infections. Honestly, it could be a combination of everything.

There’s obviously no single infection-to-symptom mapping that holds true 100% of the time. That’s undeniable. Even so, there is a high probability that certain infections produce certain symptom patterns, and that probability is quite high. I’ve been ill for 22 years now, unfortunately, and in that time I’ve met hundreds of patients with these infections. I can assure you the patterns are very clear. And in your case, your symptoms strongly suggest mold and/or infections such as Bartonella and Babesia. Moreover, the literature clearly describes how Long COVID is associated with the activation of mold/mycotoxins and with the reactivation of Bartonella, for example. In other words, your immune system was previously able to keep these infections under control, but once Long COVID disrupted everything, infections that were previously contained are now dysregulated.

I’m also absolutely convinced that you have COVID involvement in your central nervous system — whether that means active virus, residual spike protein, or small mRNA fragments that continue to drive chronic inflammation and keep the CDR switched on.

That you don’t experience fatigue does mean you may not meet strict ME/CFS criteria, but in my opinion that’s completely irrelevant. You’re clearly experiencing post-exertional symptoms, and whether you have one symptom or another changes nothing, because the underlying mechanism is the same. What actually matters is determining whether you’re currently in a more pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory state, even though the treatments will be broadly similar. This is especially true for the immune system, although not identical in every case, since in a predominantly pro-inflammatory state many anti-inflammatory treatments could noticeably improve your symptoms

---



I still haven’t been able to read your story, as I’ve spent the whole morning dealing with MENC-related matters. Honestly, the three hours I have each day to work just aren’t enough for everything.

In my view, this happens because an excess of electrons —which is essentially what NADH represents— increases reductive stress in the mitochondria. This raises the pool of electrons that cannot enter Complex II, and these electrons react with molecular oxygen to form superoxide, which in turn leads to the formation of some peroxynitrite. Both species inhibit iNOS, which further increases superoxide production. This then activates TGF-β and the NOX enzymes, generating even more superoxide.

All of this can explain the triggering effect you experienced with NADH. In addition, extracellular NADH also acts as a danger-associated stress signal —at least that’s what I remember from the literature, though it’s been a long time since I last read about it— and this could also contribute.

In any case, I wouldn’t give too much weight to the specific details of your symptoms. As I’ve told you, over these twenty-two years —especially in patients whose profiles resemble the typical patterns seen in Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, or mold-related illnesses— symptoms tend to be exactly like the ones you describe: strange, neurological, migratory, fluctuating, coming and going. And honestly, in my opinion, whether it’s intracranial pressure, visual snow, depersonalization, paresthesias, neuropathic pain, or burning sensations that appear and disappear —the details matter far less than understanding what is actually causing them.

## List of antimicrobials/agents
REVIEW OF UNIVERSAL ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS THAT COULD HELP REVERSE THE CDR STATE INDUCED BY CHRONIC INFECTIONS IN ME/CFS

All the treatments I include as tools to exit the CDR are, in fact, very potent universal antimicrobials—something clearly demonstrated in studies. Keep in mind that active infections and their consequences are what alter specific pathways in order to suppress our immune system and mitochondria and ensure their own persistence. Therefore, by correcting those infection-induced alterations, you’re actually restoring the immune system in a far more physiological way than with most antiviral treatments such as anti-PD-1 or IL-15 agonists. These approaches are generally better tolerated and, in my view, represent a more rational strategy.

To give some specific examples, most—if not all—microbes stimulate the secretion of ATP into the extracellular space, where it initially acts as a pro-inflammatory signal through purinergic receptors. However, if excessive ATP is released, this acute inflammatory state shifts toward immune exhaustion or immune apoptosis . Other pathogens convert extracellular ATP into adenosine, which is profoundly immunosuppressive. Hence, antipurinergic agents can serve as powerful broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Similarly, most microbes chronically activate mTOR, which inhibits mitochondrial function and drives immune exhaustion; thus, mTOR inhibition is inherently immunostimulatory—especially at low doses. In addition, virtually all studied microbes either contain or release nagalase, which blocks macrophage and dendritic-cell activation. GcMAF bypasses this inhibition, allowing the immune system to be activated “from above.”

On the other hand, the reduction of endorphins—caused by reductive stress, low BH₄, or excessive peroxynitrite that uncouples iNOS—leads to abnormally low MENK levels, impairing proper immune activation. Therefore, MENK should also be seen as part of the CDR recovery strategy, as it broadly enhances immune function.

Inhibiting itaconate or the enzyme IRG-1 that forms itaconate would further boost overall immunity, since this pathway is one of the main mechanisms infections use to suppress us. Additional targets could include blocking the mitochondrial-DNA efflux channels such as BAX or VDAC1.

Microbes also tend to inhibit the integrated stress response (ISR), which ultimately depletes antimicrobial strategies and chronically elevates CHOP levels, which is profoundly immune-supressive. Therefore, anything that activates the ISR or inhibits CHOP may be beneficial.

Likewise, the inflammatory cytokines and free radicals generated by infections—and by the CDR itself—increase tryptophan catabolism away from serotonin synthesis toward kynurenine and other metabolites that are highly immunosuppressive. These act mainly through AHR activation, which induces TGF-β and IDO, perpetuating a positive-feedback loop that further depletes tryptophan, reinforces immunosuppression, and favors microbial persistence. GSK-3β likely participates in similar mechanisms.

Almost all studied microbes also inhibit the vitamin D receptor (VDR), suppressing much of the innate immune response. Therefore, VDR activators such as olmesartan—as proposed by Dr. Trevor Marshall—could play a key role here.

Beyond these biochemical pathways, there are also immune-training therapies. Examples include the BCG vaccine or staphylococcal vaccines, and potentially future sublingual immunizations using Epstein–Barr, HHV-6, or enterovirus antigens. This approach has worked very well in hepatitis C, where it completely cleared the virus by boosting immunity. Along the same lines, low-dose immune therapies (LDI) using highly diluted bacterial or viral preparations—such as those for Lyme and co-infections—aim to achieve immune retraining through cross reactivity or bystander suppression.

There are also broader, more generalized antimicrobial approaches capable of targeting any infected cell regardless of the pathogen—for instance, glutamine-metabolism inhibitors. This is crucial because depriving cells of their main fuel, especially under conditions of high ketosis and low glucose, suppresses microbial growth. In mouse models of tuberculosis, such interventions enhanced immune responses and enabled clearance of infected cells.

In the same vein, salicilium—if it truly acts as proposed, namely by entering infected cells and promoting their apoptosis, as already observed in a couple of our colleagues—could also be considered part of this broader strategy of universal antimicrobial therapies.

Lys-alloferon has likewise been shown to strongly enhance the functional capacity of NK cells. However, because its effect is so targeted, it can leave the adaptive immune system (T and B cells) exhausted, meaning it should be combined with complementary therapies.

Increasing extracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels with RRX might also represent a very interesting therapeutic strategy. Although it’s true that there is significant nitrosylation of proteins and DNA, it also appears that NO levels are actually low at the endothelial and extracellular levels. Moreover, RRX would inhibit the overactive pentose phosphate pathway, helping to restore the BH₄/BH₂ ratio, reduce peroxynitrite formation, and prevent iNOS uncoupling—making it a potentially valuable approach overall to strongly stimulate the immune response.

We also know that microbes, through systemic activation of both purinergic receptors and PRRs, induce a chronic interferon-α response that remains persistently elevated over time. This sustained signaling leads to the expression of immunosuppressive genes such as PD-1 and SOCS. Inhibiting SOCS with the peptide we had been considering could therefore represent a highly valid therapeutic strategy.

Additionally, milder but still synergistic broad-spectrum antimicrobials—such as DMSO, methylene blue, iodine and high-dose vitamin C up to bowel tolerance—can further reinforce these effects, as recommended by Dr. Sarah Myhill.

There are even energetic therapies, like ultrasound applied over the spleen, which has been shown to powerfully stimulate immune activity—so much so that I personally can’t tolerate even 30 seconds of it.

Altogether, what I want to convey is that rather than searching for a single drug with a single target—most of which are highly pro-inflammatory because they abruptly activate parts of the immune system in isolation—it makes far more sense to identify why the immune system is exhausted, determine which key pathways microbes have deliberately altered to suppress us, and address those pathways directly. I believe this is the best strategy. Of course, all of this remains theoretical for now, but my partner and I are about to put it into practice.

In the past, both LDN and GcMAF helped me significantly when I had been sick for a shorter time—I went from being bedridden to studying again. Later, immune-retraining therapies such as LDI brought remarkable improvements for me, my mother, and my partner, though we never managed to sustain them long-term. Subsequently, my partner and I spent a year and a half on antipurinergic therapy, and the immune activation was unmistakable—we finally tested negative for all Lyme markers while NK-cell activity increased dramatically. All this leads me to conclude that this is indeed the right path—though it must be pursued more powerfully, with greater synergy, and for longer periods.


You’re asking a very difficult question — and I completely understand why. The theory is always easier than actually finding treatments that truly work. I can tell you which treatments target some of these pathways, but I can’t say they’re necessarily the best; we’ll have to find out over time and through practice.

In this regard, inhibiting mTOR with everolimus or rapamycin seems essential and relatively easy to do, starting at very low doses. Inhibiting AHR with TMS is also within reach. Likewise, antipurinergic therapy is fundamental; although suramin is hard to obtain, one can use Panx1 inhibitors such as probenecid or Brilliant Blue FCF. P2X7 receptors in lymph nodes can also be inhibited topically with a lidocaine base cream (I could show you how to make it). There are also inhibitors of glutamine metabolism like JHU083. Monthly BCG vaccination could help stimulate a Th1 response. It might even be possible to find GcMAF, for instance, in Dubai — although I’m unsure if what’s sold there is genuine. Interestingly, if you take salicilium and react poorly, that could be a good sign that it’s actually doing what it’s supposed to. With all this, you should ideally see a drop in nagalase and an overall boost in immune function.

RRX might also strongly enhance immune function and help address several issues like reductive stress, though it also activates NRF2 and inhibits the inflammasome — so we’ll have to see how it balances out. MENK is on the way, so hopefully in a few months we’ll know whether it truly stimulates the immune system as much as the theory and animal studies suggest. Both TGF-β1 and prostaglandin E2 inhibitors should theoretically work well, though I suspect they may cause significant side effects; we’ll have to test tolerance carefully, but they should definitely boost immune activity.

Itraconazole inhibits VDAC1 pores, blocking mitochondrial DNA release and therefore preventing cGAS activation and the downstream type I interferon response. This reduces the expression of immunosuppressive proteins such as SOCS, PD-1, and arginase, and also limits IRG-1–driven itaconate production — though for many people, including me, it’s very harsh on the gastrointestinal tract.

Another possible option is inhibiting arginase with a treatment from MM.

Additionally promoting ISR with sephin1 should help and seems to help some people. Also the KL-1333 should improve mitochondrial electron flux and activate the immune cells.) 

And I’m probably forgetting a few key ones, since I’m writing from memory. What I want to stress is that there are available treatments — I just don’t know which are the most critical, or which each individual can tolerate best. 

It’s also true that if you have mycotoxins/ mold exposure/colonization, none of these treatments are likely to work. Removing exposure to mold, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and other toxins (pesticides, VOCs, etc.) is absolutely fundamental, even if we don’t talk much about it in this group. Also removing amalgam fillings, root canals or cavitations might be really necessary for some. 

We’ll also need to see whether stimulating the immune system like this is enough for it to regain control over vector-borne infections such as Borrelia (Lyme), Bartonella, Babesia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, etc., or whether pathogen-specific antimicrobials will still be required.

It’s also very possible that another key factor to address is a fermenting gut, as explained by Dr. Sarah Myhill. It’s a continuous source of LPS, ammonia, alcohols, D-lactate, and many other mitochondrial inhibitors, and following her protocol to eliminate gut fermentation can be essential.

So, even though this isn’t the straightforward answer you were hoping for, the issue is extremely complex. All I can do is outline, at a theoretical level, the pathways that seem most relevant for escaping immune suppression — in my view, these are Nagalase, extracellular ATP, AHR, endorphin receptors, and the mechanisms tied to chronic interferon-α and itaconate signaling. Beyond that, predicting which interventions will work best is nearly impossible. We'll learn as we go! 🙂


you could start by what is readily avaliable such as rapa, TMS, brilliant blue FCF, LDN at low dose (100-1000 ug), salicilium, MENK, and perhaps GCMAF from Dubai... Starting one at a time and at a very low dose....

## Nagalase testing & GcMAF

Regarding nagalase testing, twelve years ago, when I first took GcMAF under Dr. KDM, he did test my nagalase, and it wasn’t very high — I believe around 0.9. Once I improved on GcMAF I never repeated the test, and I still haven’t repeated it to this day. The reason is that most, if not all, commercially available nagalase tests are poorly designed and do not measure the specific nagalase associated with chronic infections and cancer. Moreover, I have seen people with normal nagalase levels improve dramatically, and people with very high nagalase who were completely unable to tolerate GcMAF. And when you have a rather “quiet” form of ME/CFS, like mine, meaning mild systemic inflammation, a general hypometabolic CDR3A state, no strongly pro-inflammatory symptoms, and my main symptoms being the usual ones — physical and mental fatigue, severe gastrointestinal dysfunction, and not much else (although those symptoms are extremely severe) — the problem is that, if there is not much active immune engagement with pathogens, these pathogens tend to reside deeper in tissues and release very little nagalase into the blood. Therefore, I do not think the test is particularly meaningful, and I am convinced that some patients who start GcMAF may actually see their nagalase rise temporarily over time.

In my view, if there is evidence of immunosuppression — whether in NK cell function or in other components of the adaptive immune system — that is more than sufficient to conclude that GcMAF is absolutely necessary, because the nagalase pathway is always upregulated in these states, given that essentially all studied microbes either express nagalase on their membrane or release it into the extracellular environment.
