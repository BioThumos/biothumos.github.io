# ME/CFS, CDR, and Treatments — crisp notes

## Conceptual model

* Illness sustained by a chronic **Cell Danger Response (CDR)** with immune exhaustion, mitochondrial dysfunction, limbic sensitization, and persistent alarmins.
* Multiple perpetuators: latent/persistent infections, toxins (mold, metals, pesticides), dysbiotic/leaky gut, autoantibodies, endogenous retroviral expression, and CNS “sickness behavior” loops.
* Heterogeneity across patients; some respond to single-pathway hits, most require a **holistic, multi-pathway plan**.

## Pathophysiology (incl. PEM)

* **PEM trigger**: exertion beyond OXPHOS capacity → cytosolic anaerobic ATP ↑ → NADH/NAD⁺ ↑ (reductive stress) → reverse electron transport (RET) → ROS/RNS ↑ → mitochondrial inhibition.
* **Danger signals** during PEM: eATP, mtDNA, cardiolipin, IFN-α, PGE₂, TGF-β1, succinate, kynurenine, etc. → immune activation → 3–4 days of inflammatory CDR1 predominance and CNS-mediated fatigue signaling.
* **Limbic system** (hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate, NAcc) integrates inflammatory inputs → “sickness behavior,” autonomic shift, inhibitory signals to mitochondria.
* **Mitochondrial redox**: high NADH/NADPH, CoQ over-reduction, RET-driven superoxide/peroxynitrite; PPP flux ↑; PDH block; iNOS uncoupling with BH₄↔BH₂ imbalance → more superoxide.
* **Ca²⁺/Na⁺ dynamics**: low ATP/oxidative stress impair Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase → intracellular Na⁺ ↑ → NCX reversal → Ca²⁺ influx; ER stress (CHOP/ERO1α) and purinergic P2X/P2Y signaling further elevate cytosolic Ca²⁺; exercise can cause mito Ca²⁺ overload and ΔΨm drop.
* **Immune program**: early CDR1 (Th1/Th17, inflammasome, IFN-α/γ) → chronic shift to **CDR3A** (hypometabolic, Th2-skew, low NK/CD8 cytotoxicity, PD-1 up, itaconate loop). Persistently high/tonic **IFN-α** promotes exhaustion; **IFN-γ** tends to be low in late stages.
* **Autoantibodies/immune complexes**: diverse IgG/IgM complexes (ECM proteins, complement, viral antigens) activate TLRs/integrins/FcγR/endosomal TLR7/8/9 and GPCR targets → sustained antiviral, hypometabolic CDR.
* **Gut–immune–mitochondria**: fermentation + leakiness (LPS, D-lactate, ammonia, alcohols) → mitochondrial inhibition and immune activation; mast cells/complement/T- and B-cell stimulation maintain autoimmunity.
* **ERV/viral expression**: HHV-6, ERVs, others → inflammatory microRNAs; contributes to alarmins and tolerance programs.
* **Genetics/antigen presentation**: HLA types (e.g., DR15) and infection location (vagus, brain regions) bias disease phenotype and dominant CDR state.

## CDR framework (for reference)

* **CDR1**: inflammatory, OXPHOS down, high glycolysis, mito fission.
* **CDR2**: proliferative/fibrotic programs.
* **CDR3**: hypometabolic resolution states. Fatiguing illnesses → **CDR3B** subtype: OXPHOS deficiency, glycolysis impairment, high NADH, low lactate (context-dependent).

## Markers & testing cues

* **Hypometabolism panel ideas**: low temp, low blood lactate; urine: low aspartate, **succinate/fumarate ratio ↑**; thyroid: **TSH ↑**; immunology: **PGE₂↑, TGF-β1↑, IL-10↑, IL-5↑; IL-12↓, IFN-γ↓; NK lytic activity↓; perforin mRNA↓; CD3−CD57+↓; total IgG↓**; uric acid low; plasma AAs low; often **hs-CRP/ESR/ferritin/fibrinogen normal/low**.
* **BH₄** difficult to measure (labile); functional focus is **BH₂/BH₄ ratio** and iNOS coupling.
* **Herpes/other viruses**: lytic + latent antigens useful; saliva PCR may detect EBV shedding; some viruses (CMV/HHV-6/8/VZV, Parvo B19) require combined titers + IgA/IgM + PCR; kit cutoffs matter.
* **Home “baking soda” gastric acid test** mentioned as anecdotal; variable tolerance to acids.

## Treatment strategy (holistic, staged)

* **Foundations**: remove triggers (mold—environmental/internal, metals, pesticides); detox when tolerated (sauna, chelation, Epsom baths, binders); replete common deficits (**Mg²⁺, iodine, lithium, selenium, copper**).
* **Gut repair**: eliminate immunogenic/fermentable foods; protocols to reduce fermentation (e.g., Myhill); S. boulardii/B. subtilis; lumbrokinase; ketogenic/GAPS/carnivore-adjacent diets to lower ROS, permeability, and gut-derived toxins.
* **Immune re-activation (root-level)**:

  * **Purinergic inhibition** (suramin; P2X7/PANX1 inhibitors; topical lidocaine P2X7, Brilliant Blue FCF, probenecid). Goal: lower eATP signaling, reduce mTOR/IFN-α loops, halt lymphocyte depletion.
  * **Macrophage activation**: **GcMAF** (IV preferred) to bypass nagalase-mediated suppression.
  * **Glutamine metabolism inhibition** (e.g., JHU concept) to hit broad pathogen dependence and damp glutamate/NH₃ neuroinflammation; may lessen itaconate shunt.
  * **mTOR modulation**: low-dose **rapalogs** (e.g., everolimus 0.1 mg/d) to restore autophagy/mitophagy and exit CDR; caution after prior adverse responses.
  * **AHR inhibition** (e.g., TMS) to interrupt **kynurenine→AHR→TGF-β→JAK/IL-6** tolerogenic cycle; start ultra-low dose.
  * **JAK1 inhibition** (e.g., filgotinib) as tolerance aid or pulsed to manage **IFN-α/itaconate** loop and improve tolerability of upstream therapies.
  * **ISR/UPR support**: **Sephin1** to reduce ER stress, improve cellular repair, and enable proper immune activation.
  * **Plasma cell depletion** (future/experimental): to reduce autoantibody “memory.”
* **CNS/limbic modulation**:

  * **Transcranial ultrasound** (hypothalamus/amygdala/brainstem) to disrupt pathological neural “engrams” of sickness/fear; concept supported by animal data on conditioned responses and inflammation switches.
  * **Limbic retraining** for milder cases; peptides to reduce **CRFR2** tone.
* **Symptomatic (valuable but not causal)**:

  * **μ-opioid agonists**: central relief at the fatigue perception node (limbic, microglia, vagal signaling).
  * **Dopaminergic activation**: amphetamines, aripiprazole → reduce sickness behavior transiently.
  * **CNS depressants/GABAergic**: rebalance GABA/glutamate for sensory hyperactivation.
* **Cautions & sequencing**:

  * Many causal therapies **initially worsen symptoms** by lifting immunosuppression.
  * Avoid piling generic “mito boosters” if they raise NADH or FAO excessively in hypometabolic CDR3B.
  * **Disulfiram**: flagged as neuro-aggressive with risk of persistent deficits in this context.
  * **TGF-β inhibitors** and **RRX-001**: potentially strong; consider very low/pulsed or defer pending tolerance data.

## Selected modalities & agent notes

* **Methylene blue (MB)**:

  * **Mechanism**: accepts electrons leaking from Complex I/II/III → reduces superoxide/peroxynitrite formation; channels to H₂O₂ (handled by GPx) → improves ΔΨm, OXPHOS, ATP; raises **NAD⁺/NADH** by redox cycling at therapeutic doses.
  * **Dosing**: animal 3–10 mg/kg effective; human-equivalent \~0.48–1.6 mg/kg; pragmatic range proposed **20–70(–80) mg/day** (start \~20 mg, titrate). Low dose may **reduce** H₂O₂; very high doses become pro-oxidant (potentially useful acutely).
  * **Microbiome**: improvement up to \~1.2 mg/kg HED; \~4 mg/kg HED worsened diversity in mice.
* **Mitophagy vs danger signals**:

  * In severe, chronic CDR3B: mitochondria hyperfused; **mTORC1↑** suppresses ULK1/ATG13 and TFEB → impaired autophagic flux; forcing biogenesis/mitophagy may backfire unless **mTOR is lowered** (rapamycin restores flux).
* **TCAP-1 peptide**:

  * Counters CRF-induced dysregulation by restoring ΔΨm and **mito Ca²⁺** uptake (MCU), enhancing TCA dehydrogenases and oxidation of NADH → ATP ↑; reduces cytosolic Ca²⁺ and CRF release → **CRFR2** down-tone and serotonergic desensitization avoidance.
* **IFN-α/IFN-γ context**:

  * Early/low-dose IFN-α can prime immunity; chronic/high-tone IFN-α drives **PD-1, IL-10, apoptosis** → exhaustion; **IFN-γ** tends to be low in chronic phase. Strategy: curb IFN-α loop (AHR/JAK/mTOR/purinergic), then re-enable Th1 when feasible.
* **Autoimmunity/IgG**:

  * Broad immune complexes (ECM/viral) activate surface and endosomal PRRs and GPCRs; not a single dominant autoantibody; explains partial/variable responses to IVIG, immunoadsorption, rituximab.
* **HIV/hepatitis vs ME/CFS**:

  * All are CDR3-class chronic infections with fatigue, but HIV/hepatitis patients often retain more **exertional reserve** and lack classic delayed PEM; ME/CFS shows stronger limbic sickness-behavior and hypometabolic features.
* **Alzheimer’s analogies** (brief):

  * Holistic approaches (deep ketosis, red/IR light, ultrasound, gut de-fermentation, lectin elimination, detox for metals/mold) reported as impactful; infection/toxin load emphasized over amyloid/tau targeting.

## Practical implications for trials/stack design

* **Sequence**: remove triggers → stabilize gut/limbic → **block purinergic & AHR/JAK/mTOR** loops → enable autophagy/mitophagy → cautiously add redox/OXPHOS supports (e.g., MB) → targeted anti-infective pushes **only when** immune tone is recovering.
* **Monitor**: symptom diaries for PEM latency/severity; panels above (PGE₂, TGF-β1, NK function, cytokine profile, succinate/fumarate, thyroid, uric acid, IgG totals); consider viral assays (lytic/latent antigens; PCR in saliva/blood with attention to kit cutoffs).

**One-liners to remember**

* **PEM = transient CDR1 spike on a CDR3B baseline**, driven by reductive stress → RET → alarmins → CNS sickness amplification.
* **Do not chase single supplements**; align interventions to **de-danger**, **de-tolerize**, and **re-enable** mitochondria + immunity in concert.
