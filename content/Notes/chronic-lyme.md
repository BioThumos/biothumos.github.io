## Dr. Kaufman
###  Testing

- thinks all 3 B's have herpes-like latent/reactivation dynamics based on his experience
- doesn't pursue serology testing for this reason
	- if we accept it's a reactivating disease, antibody testing is less useful
	- 90% of his patients do test positive
- looks for more evidence before expensive & difficult treatment → looks for active disease
	- doesn't treat based on antibody results
	- only treats treats if PCR positive in blood → culture doesn't work with these organisms
	- uses TLab FISH testing
- many people don't know they have tick borne infection
	- bull's eye rash: 70% don't get it on borrelia, no rash for the other two at all
	- ticks are easy to miss

###  Treatment

- usual abx are only effective against the replicating forms, not against the latent phase (Zhang @ Hopkins, Lewis @ Northeastern, Rajadas @ Stanford)
	- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26014929/
  - confirming: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4373819/?utm_source=chatgpt.com
- effective anti-pathogenic drugs:
	- **replicating phase**: azythromycin, doxycycline
	- **latent phase**: disulfiram, methylene blue, compounded form of clotrimazole
	- **both phases**: rifampicin (potential game changer, great intracellular levels, good for bartonella, BUT interacts with everything so have to be careful)
	- unclear in which stages the below are used:
		- for borrelia/bartonella (?): clarithromycin (similar to azyth), rifampicin 
		- for babesia: add mepron, atovaquone, and/or arakoda
			- doxy/azyth not effective for babesia
		- others mentioned: cefuroxim, augmentin, amoxicilin, bactrim
- alternate between two phases every 1-2 months → unknown for how long
	- adds MB later: loves it, mostly replaced his disulfiram use
	- artimisinin sometimes
- crucial to fix the immune system
	- doesn't begin above treatment until MCAS is under control → decrease chances of drug reactions, also possibly herxes
	- interventions:
		- MB also helps to improve metabolism → immune system
		- rapamycin
		- TA1: 900 (mg? mcg?) 3x/w
		- plasmapheresis: improves immune function by lowering inflammation load
		- exosomes → herx
			- herx occurs from abx or immune cells killing the bugs
			- herx is evidence that treatment is working
			- lower dose on herx
	- thinks T-cell exhaustion is due to constant relentless antigen presentation
	- places higher importance on immune side than on direct anti-pathogen action
- doesn't retest during treatment because:
	1. TLab FISH doesn't quantify positivity
	2. negative tests lag treatments
	3. if pathogen is latent and we just want to suppress, they will likely be there
