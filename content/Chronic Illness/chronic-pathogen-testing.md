* most of these pathogens are hard to detect in their chronic stage
	* IgM won't be positive for most chronic cases
	* 16x the IgG negative upper-bound should be considered active
* **there is no single test that can prove chronic infection**, instead you need:
	* a combination of different tests
	* periodic re-testing to measure trends
	* expert analysis to match test results with symptoms to *guess* the state of your infection

## Lyme (Borrelia, Bartonella, Babesia and co-infections)
* as of date no good solution to detect chronic Lyme
* CDC-approved 2-tier testing misses 70% or so of chronic infections
* many other tests are too sensitive without enough specificity (e.g. DualDur, Armin Labs)

algorithm:
1. serology: CDC 2-tier approach: ELISA & WesternBlot. If IgM is positive for both, you have Lyme and can stop here
2. 

labs:
* Kronikler B16+ test https://www.deutsches-chroniker-labor.de/borreliose-testverfahren-zur-diagnose-von-borreliose/ablauf-des-borreliose-test.html
* Walter Tarello does direct microscopy analysis (more legit than DualDur), need to write him on FB: https://www.facebook.com/p/Walter-Tarello-1003963308/
* GalaxyDX Nanotrap antigen https://www.galaxydx.com/nanotrap-urine-test-for-lyme-disease/
	* 100% sensitive for acute phase, only 41% for chronic (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4634744/)
	* might be more tuned for US strains
* IgeneX
	* high false positive rates: https://forums.phoenixrising.me/threads/study-finds-igenex-has-a-57-5-false-positive-rate-im-horrified.49417/

opinions/anecdotes:
> Lyme testing is notoriously tough. I don’t know why we can’t meet in the middle. LLMD’s will run tests that will give everyone a positive; then normal western testing has sensitivity that shows nobody on the face of the planet has Lyme. I’d be wary of Igenex, and the pay to play testing, as it seems everyone will come up positive. I’ve heard vibrant isn’t much better.

> peptidoglycan may be a reliable test it seems

> One of my docs (an LLMD) had me do a provocation with herbs prior to a blood test. Theoretically, herbal treatment kills some spirochetes, forcing their remnants/actual spirochete out into the blood, where they can be detected. It gave me my most positive Lyme test so far (4 bands), and a clear positive for Babesia. Followed the JHU in vitro research and used Japanese knotweed, cryptolepis, and Chinese skullcap. It also made me quite ill, so tread carefully.

## EBV
algorithm:
1. serology
2. saliva PCR
3. IFT
4. LTT
5. EliSpot

labs:
* Laborwick (Austria)
	* saliva PCR
	* tests the most peptides of any test (200+)
	* aggregate score, no latent/lytic differentiator
* lab4more (Germany, only accepts German samples but you could use express shipping + a forwarder in Munich)
	* IFT + saliva PCR

## HSV

## HHV

## VZV

## Parvo B19

## Enteroviruses
* always use neutralization antibody tests
* Virologie Frankfurt

##  Mold
