* see [testing](testing.md) and [chronic-pathogen-testing](chronic-pathogen-testing.md) to determine phenotype and areas of interest

TODO:
- immunopeptidome changing to fix HLA mismatch
- itaconate shunt
- innate opiod receptor tolerance → bacopa → then methylene blue
- fosmanogepix for fungal stuff

## Basics: use in all stages
* ARA-290 → fix SFN
	* takes a long time to work, start ASAP
* electrolytes + trace minerals
	* USA: ND InfiniLyte is best
		* but expensive to import to EU
	* EU: tbd
* imidazenil → calm mast cells
	* (much) less effective alternatives: rupatadine 10mg, ketotifen, sodium cromolyn
	* > Mast cells are always involved in ME, irrespective of whether you have MCAS symptoms or not. Calming them will make it easier to tolerate later interventions and herxes.

## Stage 1


---
##  Immune reconstitution
* TA1: immune reconstitution/modulation
	* if too little immune activation → increases it
	* if too much → decreases it
	* WARNING: may cause heavy herxes, titrate up from very small dose
* anktiva/ALT-803
* soquelitinib
* BCG vaccine
* GcMAF
* salicinium
* low-dose rapamycin
* MENK

## Long COVID phenotype
> Goal is to eradicate potential viral reservoirs or viral proteins. This is quite hard as current antivirals aren't good enough.

* ensitrelvir 125mg
* sofosbuvir + ledipasvir or daclatasvir BID
* pemgarda
		* US only for now
		* kavigale (EU alternative) is not that potent sadly
* general immune and autophagy boosting strategies likely work better as noneo of the current antivirals are good enough to clear deep CNS reservoirs
* potentially: 

## Gut: SIBO, leaky gut, dysbiosis
* fix fecal loading
* fix dysbiosis: can't do without fixing hypothalamus inflammation

- D-larazotide → fix zonulin-mediated leaky gut
	- > L- amino version doesn't work, half-life is too short
	- zonulin + potential other off-targets
- KPV
- asimadoline: K-OR antagonist
	- decrease gut inflammation
	- 
## CDR
* suramin
* antipurinergics: Brilliant Blue CFC

## Mitochondrial
- SBT-272
- KL-1333

## Autophagy


## Autoimmunity
need to drain long lived dysfunctional plasma cells
do this after reconsituting immune system and getting rid of pathogens (otherwise too dangerous)
TODO link paper/tweet


## TODO sort
* meldonium 500mg BID
*
