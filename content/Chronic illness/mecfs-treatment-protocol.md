* see [testing](testing.md) and [chronic-pathogen-testing](chronic-pathogen-testing.md) to determine phenotype and areas of interest

TODO:
- immunopeptidome changing to fix HLA mismatch
- itaconate shunt
- innate opiod receptor tolerance → bacopa → then methylene blue
- fosmanogepix for fungal stuff

## Basics: use in all stages
* ARA-290 → fix SFN
	* takes a long time to work, start ASAP
* electrolytes + trace minerals
	* USA: ND InfiniLyte is best
		* but expensive to import to EU
	* EU: tbd
* imidazenil → calm mast cells
	* (much) less effective alternatives: rupatadine 10mg, ketotifen, sodium cromolyn
	* > Mast cells are always involved in ME, irrespective of whether you have MCAS symptoms or not. Calming them will make it easier to tolerate later interventions and herxes.

## Stage 1


---
##  Immune reconstitution
* TA1: immune reconstitution/modulation
	* if too little immune activation → increases it
	* if too much → decreases it
	* WARNING: may cause heavy herxes, titrate up from very small dose
* anktiva/ALT-803
* soquelitinib
* BCG vaccine
* GcMAF
* salicinium
* low-dose rapamycin
* MENK

## Long COVID phenotype
> Goal is to eradicate potential viral reservoirs or viral proteins. This is quite hard as current antivirals aren't good enough.

* ensitrelvir 125mg
* sofosbuvir + ledipasvir or daclatasvir BID
* pemgarda
		* US only for now
		* kavigale (EU alternative) is not that potent sadly
* general immune and autophagy boosting strategies likely work better as noneo of the current antivirals are good enough to clear deep CNS reservoirs
* potentially: 

## Gut: SIBO, leaky gut, dysbiosis
* fix fecal loading
* fix dysbiosis: can't do without fixing hypothalamus inflammation

- D-larazotide → fix zonulin-mediated leaky gut
	- > L- amino version doesn't work, half-life is too short
	- zonulin + potential other off-targets
- KPV
- asimadoline: K-OR antagonist
	- decrease gut inflammation
	- 
## CDR
* suramin
* antipurinergics: Brilliant Blue CFC

## Mitochondrial
- SBT-272
- KL-1333

## Autophagy


## Autoimmunity
need to drain long lived dysfunctional plasma cells
do this after reconsituting immune system and getting rid of pathogens (otherwise too dangerous)
TODO link paper/tweet


## TODO sort
* meldonium 500mg BID


- **mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, rapamycin)** – inhibit chronically overactivated mTOR to relieve mitochondrial inhibition and reverse immune exhaustion.
    
- **Antipurinergic / Panx1 blockade (suramin, probenecid, Brilliant Blue FCF)** – reduce extracellular ATP signaling and purinergic-driven immune exhaustion.
    
- **P2X7 blockade (topical lidocaine base cream over lymph nodes)** – locally inhibit P2X7 receptors to damp chronic ATP-mediated immunosuppression.
    
- **GcMAF** – bypasses nagalase-mediated blockade to activate macrophages and dendritic cells “from above.”
    
- **MENK (met-enkephalin)** – replaces deficient endorphin tone to enhance broad immune activation via opioid receptors.
    
- **Itaconate / IRG-1 inhibitors** – block the itaconate pathway used by microbes to suppress innate immunity and T-cell function.
    
- **BAX / VDAC1 inhibition (e.g., itraconazole for VDAC1)** – limit mtDNA efflux and cGAS–STING–type I IFN signaling that induces SOCS, PD-1, arginase, and chronic immunosuppression.
    
- **ISR activators (e.g., sephin1)** – restore the integrated stress response, replenish antimicrobial programs, and lower CHOP-driven immune suppression.
    
- **CHOP inhibitors (conceptual)** – directly reduce CHOP to relieve a key brake on immune function in chronic stress states.
    
- **AHR inhibitors (e.g., TMS)** – counter kynurenine/AHR/TGF-β/IDO feedback that depletes tryptophan and enforces tolerogenic, immunosuppressed states.
    
- **GSK-3β modulation (likely inhibition)** – target another node linked to chronic IFN signaling, tolerance, and T-cell exhaustion.
    
- **VDR activators (e.g., olmesartan)** – overcome infection-induced VDR blockade and restore vitamin-D–dependent innate immunity.
    
- **Immune-training vaccines (BCG, staphylococcal vaccines, mucosal EBV/HHV-6/enterovirus antigens)** – train or bias the immune system toward more effective Th1 / antiviral responses.
    
- **Low-dose immune therapy (LDI) with microbial antigens** – use highly diluted bacterial/viral preparations to retrain immunity via cross-reactivity or bystander mechanisms.
    
- **Glutamine metabolism inhibitors (e.g., JHU083)** – starve infected cells and intracellular microbes of glutamine, especially under ketosis/low glucose.
    
- **Salicilium** – proposed to enter infected cells and selectively trigger their apoptosis (strong reactions may signal target engagement).
    
- **Lys-alloferon** – markedly enhances NK cell cytotoxic function but may require support for adaptive (T/B) immunity.
    
- **RRX** – raises extracellular NO, inhibits an overactive pentose phosphate pathway, improves BH₄/BH₂ balance, and may reduce peroxynitrite/iNOS uncoupling while stimulating immunity.
    
- **SOCS-inhibiting peptide** – blocks SOCS-mediated negative feedback induced by chronic type I IFN, potentially reversing PD-1/arginase–type immunosuppression.
    
- **TGF-β1 inhibitors** – relieve a central tolerogenic cytokine brake, potentially restoring more aggressive antiviral/antimicrobial responses.
    
- **Prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) inhibitors** – reduce a key lipid mediator of immune suppression and tumor/microbe tolerance.
    
- **Arginase inhibitors (MM compound)** – prevent arginine depletion that otherwise impairs T-cell and NO-dependent antimicrobial activity.
    
- **DMSO** – mild broad-spectrum antimicrobial and penetration enhancer that can synergize with other agents.
    
- **Methylene blue** – redox-active antimicrobial that supports mitochondrial electron flow and may inhibit some pathogens.
    
- **Iodine** – broad-spectrum antimicrobial active against many bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
    
- **High-dose vitamin C (to bowel tolerance)** – pro-oxidant antimicrobial in high doses and general immune cofactor.
    
- **Ultrasound over the spleen** – energetic stimulation of splenic immune cells with strong, sometimes poorly tolerated, immune activation.
    
- **Low-dose naltrexone (LDN, 100–1000 µg range here)** – ultra-low dose opioid modulation to boost endorphins and rebalance immune activity.
    
- **Environmental detox (mold, mycotoxins, heavy metals, VOCs, pesticides)** – remove ongoing toxic/inflammatory loads that otherwise block response to immune-stimulatory therapies.
    
- **Dental source control (amalgams, root canals, cavitations)** – eliminate potential chronic infectious/toxic foci undermining immune recovery.
    
- **Pathogen-specific antimicrobials (Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, etc.)** – targeted agents if immune re-activation alone cannot clear vector-borne infections.
    
- **Anti-fermentative gut protocol (Dr. Sarah Myhill)** – suppress gut fermentation (LPS, ammonia, alcohols, D-lactate) that chronically poisons mitochondria and immunity.
    
- **KL-1333** – NAD+/electron-flux modulator aimed at improving mitochondrial electron transport and immune cell energetics.
    
- **Monthly BCG revaccination** – repeated trained-immunity stimulus toward stronger Th1/innate responses.
    
- **Staphylococcal vaccines** – additional immune-training strategy targeting staph-related tolerance patterns.
    
- **Experimental sublingual viral antigens (EBV, HHV-6, enteroviruses)** – localized mucosal immune retraining against key suspected drivers.






------------------


Got it, let’s do this properly and include **everything**, with **mechanism + key warning** in each bullet, no partitions.

_(All of this is theoretical / experimental and **not** medical advice.)_

- **Environmental detox (mold, mycotoxins, metals, VOCs, dental foci)** – Removes ongoing immune-blocking/toxic load; _mobilizing toxins or doing aggressive chelation can trigger major inflammatory crashes_.
    
- **Myhill anti-fermentation gut protocol** – Reduces LPS, ammonia, alcohols, D-lactate from a fermenting gut; _over-restriction or excessive antimicrobials can damage the microbiome and nutrition_.
    
- **Pathogen-specific antimicrobials (Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, etc.)** – Directly debulk vector-borne infections; _can cause severe Herx reactions and resistance if misused_.
    
- **Antipurinergic therapy (suramin, probenecid, Brilliant Blue FCF, topical lidocaine on lymph nodes)** – Blocks extracellular ATP/P2X7/Panx1 signaling that drives immune exhaustion; _suramin is toxic and hard to source, and all purinergic blockers can blunt necessary inflammation or stress kidneys/liver_.
    
- **Rapamycin / Everolimus** – Low-dose mTOR inhibition to counter chronic microbe-driven immune exhaustion and mitochondrial suppression; _too much or too fast can cause frank immunosuppression, infections, mouth ulcers, and lipid/glucose issues_.
    
- **GcMAF** – Bypasses nagalase to reactivate macrophages and dendritic cells “from above”; _preparations vary wildly in quality, and strong cytokine flares or autoimmune-like reactions have been reported_.
    
- **MENK (met-enkephalin)** – Replaces endorphin deficit to enhance immune activation; _can provoke intense immune flares, hypotension, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in sensitive patients_.
    
- **Low-dose naltrexone (100–1000 µg microdoses)** – Gently upregulates endorphin tone and modulates immunity; _even tiny doses can disturb sleep, mood, or cause transient symptom worsening_.
    
- **IRG-1 / itaconate pathway modulation (itraconazole, 4-octyl-itaconate, dimethyl-itaconate, ITA-5/ITA-9)** – Targets a key immunometabolic brake exploited by microbes; _itaconate signaling is context-dependent, sometimes anti-inflammatory, so wrong direction/setting could worsen immunosuppression or inflammation_.
    
- **Itraconazole (VDAC1 inhibitor / IRG-1 down-regulation)** – Blocks VDAC1 pores, mtDNA efflux and downstream type-I IFN/SOCS/PD-1 induction; _commonly causes GI upset, drug-drug interactions, and carries real hepatotoxic risk_.
    
- **BAX/VDAC1 blockade (conceptual BAX inhibitors, VDAC1 inhibitors like itraconazole)** – Limits mitochondrial-DNA escape that drives chronic interferon signaling; _over-blocking apoptosis or mitochondrial stress signaling may impair normal cell turnover and cancer surveillance_.
    
- **Sephin1 (ISR activator)** – Prolongs protective ISR signaling and can reduce CHOP-mediated immune suppression; _chronic ISR manipulation risks worsening some ER-stress diseases or provoking maladaptive stress responses_.
    
- **ISRIB (powerful ISR modulator, experimental)** – Normalizes some aspects of the ISR and has CNS effects; _very potent, research-only, and could unpredictably alter brain and immune stress responses_.
    
- **TMS (AHR inhibitor)** – Directly blocks kynurenine–AHR signaling to relieve tryptophan-driven immunosuppression; _limited human data, possible liver enzyme changes and off-target effects_.
    
- **Epacadostat / Linrodostat (IDO1 inhibitors)** – Reduce tryptophan → kynurenine flux and downstream AHR/TGF-β loops; _trial failures in oncology, with potential for immune overactivation or paradoxical effects_.
    
- **CH223191 (AHR antagonist, preclinical)** – Blocks AHR activation more directly; _research-grade only, human safety profile essentially unknown_.
    
- **Lithium / Tideglusib (GSK-3β inhibitors)** – Modulate exhaustion-related signaling and may enhance immune function; _lithium needs serum monitoring (kidney/thyroid), tideglusib is experimental with sparse safety data_.
    
- **Olmesartan (VDR-related ARB)** – Proposed to relieve microbe-driven VDR blockade and support innate immunity; _ARB risks: hypotension, hyperkalemia, kidney strain, and controversy around the Marshall protocol_.
    
- **BCG vaccination (and other trained-immunity vaccines)** – Trains innate/Th1 responses and can boost broad antiviral/antimicrobial tone; _can trigger strong systemic inflammation and is contraindicated in many immunocompromised states_.
    
- **Staphylococcal vaccines / future sublingual EBV–HHV-6–enterovirus immunizations** – Attempt to train more specific anti-pathogen responses; _risk of flares, autoimmunity, and unpredictable cross-reactivity_.
    
- **LDI (low-dose immunotherapy for Lyme and co-infections)** – Uses ultra-dilute antigens to retrain immune tolerance/recognition; _responses can be biphasic, with both severe flares and loss of effect over time_.
    
- **Glutamine-metabolism inhibitors (JHU083, DON, CB-839)** – Starve infected/immunosuppressive cells of glutamine under low-glucose/high-ketone conditions; _also starve normal proliferating cells (gut, immune, marrow) leading to GI, immune, and nutritional complications_.
    
- **Salicilium** – Designed to enter infected cells and trigger apoptosis; _poorly characterized, and the strong negative reactions some people get suggest potent, poorly controllable effects_.
    
- **Lys-alloferon** – Strongly boosts NK-cell cytotoxicity and innate responses; **if used continuously without broader support it can exhaust NK cells and leave adaptive T/B compartments more depleted and “burned out”**.
    
- **ALT-803 (IL-15 superagonist)** – Massive NK and CD8 T-cell stimulation; _high risk of cytokine-like reactions, fevers, and autoimmune-type flares_.
    
- **RRX (extracellular NO enhancer, PPP inhibitor)** – Increases endothelial/extracellular NO, improves BH₄/BH₂, reduces peroxynitrite and iNOS uncoupling; _NO shifts can trigger migraines, hypotension, and nitrosative stress if redox is not balanced_.
    
- **TGF-β1 inhibitors** – Lift a major suppressive cytokine brake on immunity; _high potential for fibrosis, autoimmunity, and loss of tissue protection if pushed too far_.
    
- **PGE₂ inhibitors** – Reduce prostaglandin-mediated immune suppression; _can damage GI mucosa, kidneys, and blunt useful inflammatory signaling_.
    
- **Arginase inhibitors** – Increase arginine availability for NO and T-cell function; _excess NO formation may drive oxidative/nitrosative damage and worsen some vascular issues_.
    
- **KL-1333** – NAD⁺/electron-transport enhancer to improve mitochondrial flux in immune cells; _still experimental, full risk profile in complex chronic illness is unknown_.
    
- **Telmisartan (NO-modulating ARB)** – Increases endothelial NO via ADMA/DDAH and has PPAR-γ effects; _same ARB cautions (BP drop, kidney stress), plus metabolic shifts that may not suit everyone_.
    
- **DMSO** – Penetrant solvent with mild antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions; _strong odor, can carry other chemicals through skin, and may provoke histamine-like or oxidative reactions_.
    
- **Methylene blue** – Antimicrobial, redox and mitochondrial modulator; _interacts with SSRIs (serotonin syndrome risk), can cause hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, and overuse is neurotoxic_.
    
- **Iodine** – Broad antiseptic and antimicrobial agent; _excessive systemic iodine can provoke thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity_.
    
- **High-dose vitamin C (to bowel tolerance)** – Antioxidant and mild antimicrobial that supports phagocytes; _can worsen oxalate issues, cause kidney stones in predisposed people, and provoke strong Herx-type reactions IV/oral_.
    
- **Ultrasound over spleen** – Mechanically stimulates splenic immune activity; _can produce overwhelming immune activation or flares even after very short exposures_.
    

If you want, next step could be:

- a **“tiered” version**: which of these are _readily accessible + relatively gentler_ vs _high-risk / research-only_, still keeping the bullets short.
