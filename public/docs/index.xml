&lt;p>Knowledge based on the experience of friends far more knowledgeable than me, as well as my own attempts and many hours of research, containing hard-to-find information from esoteric internet forums.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Injection or capsules?&lt;/strong> Most peptides are not bioavailable orally and have little bioavailability sublingually, so unfortunately you will have to inject if you want the full benefits. This guide focuses on IM (intramuscular) or subQ (subcutaneous) injections.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Peptides are a legal grey area. Very few of them have been authorized for human use by health agencies (one example is Zadaxin – TA1), yet all of them are sold for &amp;ldquo;research use&amp;rdquo; – and that is how you can buy them. All sources will tell you their compounds are not for human consumption, which they do to stay legally compliant, but it is also why you have to make absolutely sure the ones you buy have third-party purity and content testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Long COVID Prevention Protocol</title><link>https://zagreushealth.github.io/docs/covid-protocol/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zagreushealth.github.io/docs/covid-protocol/</guid><description>&lt;div class="pageinfo pageinfo-primary">

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>COVID hasn&amp;rsquo;t gone away: almost everyone gets infected 1-3x/year, many develop LC (5%, up to 30% have some damage even after mild infx)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Not like a normal virus, need to adjust priors:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The more often you catch it, the more immunocompromised you will be&lt;/strong>, as opposed to training your immune system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many had a few, probably mild infections before developing LC. For me it was the 3rd or 4th.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Threat model is &lt;em>not intuitive&lt;/em>:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mild acute infection ≠ low LC risk! Mine was mild too.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be traditionally &amp;ldquo;at risk&amp;rdquo; (obesity, diabetes, old age) to develop LC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>LC risk grows linearly with number of infx&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>NO CURE FOR LC&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h5 id="buy-the-things-now-dont-leave-it-for-the-last-moment">Buy the things now, don&amp;rsquo;t leave it for the last moment.&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#buy-the-things-now-dont-leave-it-for-the-last-moment" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h5>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Goal: &lt;strong>detect an infection early and aggressively reduce viral load ASAP&lt;/strong>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Anything less will greatly increase your LC risk.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remember: significant latency in suspecting exposure → testing positive → getting your doctor to prescribe the drugs here (or worse, waiting for delivery) → starting dosing. This makes or breaks your protocol.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Small investment, but avoiding losing your life (not being able to get out of bed for years, like the most severe patients) or losing 2SD FSIQ (happened to me and other formerly outlier IQ people I know) is worth a few grand.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Think of this as insurance/hedging.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make friends with your doctor so he can prescribe you what you want.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make a traveling kit as travels are high risk for infection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Test all the medicine listed here at least once (separately) to make sure you tolerate them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Costs (estimate):
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one time: €500-1000 (air purifier, testing equipment)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>monthly: $200 (supplements, masks)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>per infx: €200-1500 (depending on choices)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>nasal + oral sprays&lt;/strong> before/after socializing/exposure:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the &lt;strong>bare minimum&lt;/strong> you should do, especially when you cannot mask. Even the best masks are not perfect, every layer of protection reduces your chances of infection.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
