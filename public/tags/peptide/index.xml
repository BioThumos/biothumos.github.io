&lt;p>&lt;strong>Injection or capsules?&lt;/strong> Most peptides are not bioavailable orally and have little bioavailability sublingually, so unfortunately you will have to inject if you want the full benefits. This guide focuses on IM (intramuscular) or subQ (subcutaneous) injections.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Peptides are a legal grey area. Very few of them have been authorized for human use by health agencies (one example is Zadaxin – TA1), yet all of them are sold for &amp;ldquo;research use&amp;rdquo; – and that is how you can buy them. All sources will tell you their compounds are not for human consumption, which they do to stay legally compliant, but it is also why you have to make absolutely sure the ones you buy have third-party purity and content testing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
