Only established advice is included here. If you know me, ask for prescription-free sources I can’t list publicly.\nPreface\nOn risk – it’s kind of a Russian roulette\n\nCOVID hasn’t gone away: almost everyone gets infected 1-3x/year, many develop LC (5%, up to 30% have some damage even after mild infx)\nNot like a normal virus, need to adjust priors:\n\nThe more often you catch it, the more immunocompromised you will be, as opposed to training your immune system.\nMany had a few, probably mild infections before developing LC. For me it was the 3rd or 4th.\n\n\nThreat model is not intuitive:\n\nMild acute infection ≠ low LC risk! Mine was mild too.\nYou don’t have to be traditionally “at risk” (obesity, diabetes, old age) to develop LC.\nLC risk grows linearly with number of infx\n\n\nNO CURE FOR LC\n\nBuy the things now, don’t leave it for the last moment.\n\nGoal: detect an infection early and aggressively reduce viral load ASAP.\n\nAnything less will greatly increase your LC risk.\nRemember: significant latency in suspecting exposure → testing positive → getting your doctor to prescribe the drugs here (or worse, waiting for delivery) → starting dosing. This makes or breaks your protocol.\n\n\nSmall investment, but avoiding losing your life (not being able to get out of bed for years, like the most severe patients) or losing 2SD FSIQ (happened to me and other formerly outlier IQ people I know) is worth a few grand.\n\nThink of this as insurance/hedging.\n\n\nMake friends with your doctor so he can prescribe you what you want.\nMake a traveling kit as travels are high risk for infection.\nTest all the medicine listed here at least once (separately) to make sure you tolerate them.\nCosts (estimate):\n\none time: €500-1000 (air purifier, testing equipment)\nmonthly: $200 (supplements, masks)\nper infx: €200-1500 (depending on choices)\n\n\n\nInfection prevention\nNasal + oral sprays before/after socializing/exposure\n\n\n\nThis is the bare minimum you should do, especially when you cannot mask. Even the best masks are not perfect, every layer of protection reduces your chances of infection.\n\n\nnasal:\n\nNO (nitric oxide) based - SaNOtize formula:  EU €17\n\n\n\nNote that the product name varies by region (Enovid, Virx, etc). See **distributors **.\n\n\n\n\nor astrodimer sodium based: EU €10\n\n\n\nA direct virucidal, may be less irritating than NO or carrageenan based sprays, which is recommended for people already chronically ill (e.g. with LC).\n\n\n\n\nor HPMC based\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9969373/\n\n\n\nNitric oxide nasal spray (NONS) from SaNOtize has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 viral loads in clinical trials. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) nasal sprays like Taffix from Nasus Pharma have also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\noral:\n\nTODO\n\n\n\nMasking\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to wear a mask at all times (understandable), infection risk is likely Pareto distributed and most of it happens in transmission hubs: hospitals, clinics, flights, airports, schools, taxi, public transport, grocery shopping (anywhere people have/want to go even if sick; very few people go to gym when sick). You could mask in these places and otherwise not.\n\n\nN95/FFP2 mask or better (ideally FFP3): 3M Aura 1873V+, 3M Aura 9332+, or other 3M Aura with head straps (not earloops)\nVitacore CAN99 9500 or similar for MRI (most masks have metal components)\nlist of reliable sources\n\nSupplements\n\nantiviral (3CLpro inhibitor):\n\nsumac (effective for price): maybe drink it as a “cocktail” as eating it is harsh pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9729036/\nrhamnan sulfates: pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8707894/\n\nJapanese seaweeds (cheap): Monostroma nitidum or Ulva pertusa based only (red seaweeds won’t work)\nor Arterosil (expensive but has other benefits) – EU €85/month\n\n\ngreen tea (EGCG): * pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919953/\n\nalso most polyphenols, especially with a gallate group\n\n\n\n\nnattokinase/serraptase: binds and degrades spike protein, degrades biofilm where viral reservoirs can form, and busts plaque that can worsen COVID cardiovascular issues – global\nalpha-lipoic-acid (ALA) – Na-R-ALA/BioEnhanced formula: improves microvasculature and immune defenses, against COVID &amp; flu A – global US\nbasics: zinc, basic vitamins &amp; especially C/B/D, magnesium, omega-3 (only get pharma grade ethyl-ester form, eg Lovaza/Omacor), etc\n\n\n\n💡 Deficiencies in general as well as a poor gut biome make one perdisposed to chronic illness and so also LC.\n\n\n\n\n[optional] may have some basic effect: selenium, NAC, CBD, black cumin seeds/black seed oil, curcumin, garlic, ginger, pomegranate\n\nTesting\n\n\n\n💡 You want a test with high sensitivity (correctly captures positive results) and high specificity (correctly identifies negatives).\n\n\n[best] at home with PlusLife (98.91%/100%) – EU €260 + €6/test\n\n\n\nThis ends up being the cheapest option long term, especially if you have a family. If you travel a lot, work with people, or have school children, this is worth the investment.\n\n\n\n\n[alternative] Metrix is similar to PlusLife, tests are more expensive though\n[alternative] get a PCR done at a lab, you can usually pay a little extra for express results\nrapid antigen tests (RATs) are probably no longer viable\n\n\n\nAnecdotally, they don’t seem to detect newer variants, it’s unclear why.\n\n\n\n\n\nHygiene\n\nsoap (not alcohol) hand washing\n\nAir quality\n\nCOVID is airborne, so maintaining good air quality is important for your home when you have guests over or a family member is sick, your office, your children’s classrooms, etc\n\n\n\n💡 If you have a family, understanding airflow is important when dealing with infections – one person can be sick, but as long as they have negative air pressure in their room and positive pressure everywhere else, virus won’t escape their room and infect everyone else. Eg: fans/HEPA filters/open windows in hallway with airflow pointing towards the sick person’s room, fan in room directing air towards window. Wear a mask when going into their room.\n\n\n\n\n💡 The easiest way to reduce risk of your child getting infected in school (major transmission hub) is to donate a few high CFM HEPA air purifiers to their classroom.\n\n\n\n\n💡 Aim for &lt;700ppm CO2 concentration indoors (outdoor baseline: ~400ppm), as higher concentrations indicate poor circulation and so more viral particles in air.\n\n\n\n\nCO2 monitors:\n\n[best] Aranet4 – €180\n[alternative]: AirFanta G2 Air Quality Monitor – $100\n\n\nair purifiers w/ HEPA filters:\n\ndo NOT get ozone/ionizers → carcinogenic\nCFM (cubic feet per meter): only relevant metric, higher=better; can also use multiple small devices in a large room\n[best]: AirFanta 3Pro: aesthetics might be a problem – €180\n\nyou can DYI build this too, google Corsi-Rosenthal\n\n\n[expensive/alternative]: Coway AirMega: looks better but much more expensive – €500\n\n\nmore info: main autist in this domain (also good)\n\nMasking + antivirals &gt; vaccines:\n\n\n\nI don’t think the vax risk/reward is worth it, definitely isn’t with mRNA, due to design (eg if mRNA lipid particles circulate to heart or other sensitive areas and create RNA factories in those cells) and quality control (QC) issues, and while Novavax is better, you’re still injecting spike proteins that cause half the issues in LC, and if the QC is as poor with Novavax as with Pfizer, those spikes may not be properly neutralized. I can’t tell, inject at own risk.\n\n\nC19 mutates rapidly → vaccines quickly become ineffective → require regular shots every few months → increased Long Vax risk (law of large numbers)\n\n[advanced] monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) – $1500:\n\nmore effective and seemingly less risky than vaccines\n\nyou are essentially injecting the end result of the vaccines - the antibodies - without the spike exposure risk\n\n\neffective protection for 6 months, can repeat\nthere are always new versions to tackle the latest variant\n\nlatest Sipavibart\n\n\n\nAcute stage treatment\n\n⚠️ Follow these steps as soon as you notice first symptoms, before waiting for a positive test.\n\nOutline\n\ndouble key supplement doses\nhigh dose famotidine\ntest → if positive, continue\nchoose based on budget and tolerance:\n\n(a) antiviral – $1200 [preferred]\n\nensitrelvir or paxlovid\n[optional] reduce famotidine dose\nafter 2-3 days: immune modulator\n\n\n\n\n(b) metformin – dirt cheap\n(c) TA1 – $150 [advanced]\n\n\n\nIn detail\n\n⚠️ Timing is important.

We need to tame excessive immune activation without suppression.\n\n\n[preferred] bitter melon (supplement): 2-8g/day\n\nbest/also good/or this\na slightly weaker AMPK activator, like metformin\n\n\n[alternative] low dose metformin (prescription): 1-2x500mg/day\n\nif you have metformin, which is much cheaper than high-quality supplements, you could use a low dose\n\n\n\nLow quality supplements are a waste of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[advanced/alternative] TA1 peptide – see choice (c) below for details\n\n\n💡 The idea of using weaker or smaller dose immune modulators here is that with famotidine &amp; antivirals effectively targeting viral spread and infected cells, respectively, inflammation should not be as much.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) metformin – very cheap\n\n\n\n💡 Due to a lack of antivirals to target infected cells, we assume inflammation is high, so metformin – which is a potent anti-inflammatory – is used.\n\n\nstart as soon as you get a positive test\nrequires a prescription\n\n\ntitrate: 500mg on day 1, 500mg twice daily on days 2–5, then 500mg in the morning and 1000mg in the evening up to day 14\n\n\n~40% reduction of LC incidence (www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(21)00138-1/fulltext &amp; www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00299-2/fulltext)\n\n(c) Thymosin Alpha 1 (TA1) – $150 [advanced]\n\n\n\n⚠️ This step is only recommended if you have experience with peptides, therefore I’m not going into too much detail here.\n\n\n\n\nyou can start this upon first symptom presentation, as it’s useful even if it’s not COVID\nimmune modulator: if too little immune activation → increases it; if too much → lowers it\nif you don’t like subcutaneous (subQ) injections:\n\ntry Thymogen oral capsules, which are not as effective as subQ but still good and far less hassle\notherwise use your favorite source (or feel free to ask) to get the subQ TA1\n\n\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8366398 and pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10030336/\n\nExperimental\n\nThe above should be enough to get you there most of the way, but if you really want to be sure, add these to your protocol.\nhigh-dose melatonin:\n\nNo enough clinical trials on this but it’s harmless enough with big potential upside that I’m including it.\nDorris Loh (author of protocol) claims this is sufficient but given the experimental nature of it, I’d do the other things in this document to be sure.

If you have active inflammatory processes, IL-10 is one of the primary anti-inflammatory cytokines and should act as counterweight.\nNK cell dysreg:\nThe NK cell dysregulation could be in part due to stimulation by TRPA1, hydrogen sulfide producers in gut (Bilophila wadsworthia, Desulfovibrio sp.) can exacerbate this issue I believe\nCD16+ CD56dim NKs express TRPA1, CD16- CD56++ NKs don’t\non cytokine testing:\nIn general, cytokine tests are not fantastic. You have so many different enzymes in blood/on surface of cells which cleave different cytokines, and many are released locally to impact a small area/have differing local and systemic actions. We don’t even know if the blood tubes we use neutralize all these enzymes/proteins which can impact results\nUntil we understand how cytokines are regulated by in vivo factors fully, I believe these tests have limited validity\naprepitant:\nI chose aprepitant as it is the halfway house between rapa and classical anti-inflammatories - less risk of fertility problems in future, and 3-5 day short courses which means low risk and low cost for people around the world to use\nToll like receptor 4 is activated by LPS from bacterial cell walls, COVID spike, mannan from fungal cell membranes, and DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns, which we release when tissue is injured - HMGB1 and the EDA domain of fibronectin especially)\nAprepitant mutes the  TLR4 → NF-kB → MAPK → mTOR pathways indirectly - NK-1R is a critical part of feedback loop inducing a response to TLR4 agonists. Aprepitant however doesn’t bind TLR4 itself, so there is a low risk of significant immunosuppression causing bacterial or fungal infections\nWhether it is cellular/somatic stressors, cell death elsewhere, emotional trauma, COVID spike/other viruses, many bacteria, many fungi - they all end up activating TLR4. This is why I like to focus on it somewhat, it is central to many pathologies\nI also believe this is why chronic emotional stress can be immunosuppressive, stress inflames you, you downregulate immune function over time to protect yourself when highly inflamed\nAprepitant can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and a couple of NSPs\nAprepitant plus dexamethasone works on severe late stage (hospitalised COVID) patients\nwww.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.01.20166678v3.full\nDosage is insufficient I think. 125mg does not* occupy all available brain NK-1R receptors\nAprepitant specifically targets the capacity to respond to inflammation/somatic stress. It targets the immune system/microglia, but also mucosal tissues, neurons themselves, fibroblasts and other important cell types\nThere are about 20 different reasons I chose aprepitant - it has been trialled to reduce T cells exhaustion in HIV patientspmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5841871/\nIt can target a thrombin → substance P pathway which prevents repair/haematoma clearance after neurological injury link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-021-01077-8\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032717310066%3Dihub\nProper research into aprepitant was stalled because they fucked up most of the preliminary studies for trials, or indeed they fucked up the major trials it was in\nwww.nature.com/articles/s44298-024-00018-4\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9693925/\nPotent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, tested in human lung tissue (aprepitant, everolimus, sirolimus, fluvoxamine) inhibit mTOR and therefore activate Wnt signalling\neffect on NK-1R:\nlink.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12974-018-1098-4\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5807668/\nNK-1R antagonists do modulate LPS/TLR4 signalling - without NK-1R (either by knockout or inhibition), LPS or other TLR4 agonists do not induce fever\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8988161/\nNK-1R is thought to contribute towards the ability of monocytes to cross BBB into brain, in neuro HIV (aka HAND) and other conditions\nThis is another one -\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923020305116\n“Inhibition of NK1R attenuates LPS-induced microglial inflammation and consequent death of PC12 cells”\ntemporary ganglion block therapy?\nWhat might make aprepitant frickin sweet is that it targets the multiple sympathetic inputs and outputs - it can reduce cytokines/GDF15 or other pro inflammatory/sympathetic nervous system activating substances in the body. It can also reduce TLR4/glutamate in the brain itself, and reduce sympathetic outflow feom neurons expressing NK-1R in spinal cord\nSo, it might act somewhat similarly to a temporary stellate ganglion block\ndoesn’t fix structural issues:\nAprepitant doesn’t get rid of structural issues, chronic infections, microbiome issues; it may resolve glutamate/glutamine issues (and reversed my neuropathy/tinnitus), but it essentially just gives you a few days break so you can soft reset\nreduces ROS:\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0024320524008002%3Dihub\nAprepitant is useful as an adjunct to chemotherapy. Doxorubicin can damage the brain; aprepitant reduces inflammation/ROS generation (myeloperoxidase mentioned here, endoplasmic reticulum stress would be relevant also)\ntemporary or permanent fix?\nSome people have a kinda rough couple of days on aprep then do much better after a few days recalibration (myself and others who respond well)\nSome people do seem to do well on it, but don’t get a large long term benefit\nSo it almost seems like the people who have a rough time on aprepitant do better in the long term\nThen the people who barely notice they have taken it/the people who do much better whilst on it get no or a small amount of benefit\n[why?] Structural issues likely, for many\nCCI, atlantoaxial instability, or other severe pathology - my friend with Chiari did not respond to aprepitant at all, for example\nVascular compression could also make sense, yeah\nVascular compression is completely different to a vasculature which isn’t properly reactive\nSomeone with Eagle syndrome tried aprepitant and got a small amount of benefit, iirc\nThe major ideas;\n1/ COVID spike is the most important pro-inflammatory factor - it activates TLR4/NF-kB axis, causing inflammation. Aprepitant indirectly reduces TLR4/NF-kB signalling via NK-1R inhibition; natural killer cells are more active when NK-1R is inhibited, so it is not potently immunosuppressive\n2/ aprepitant stops somatic stressors from activating neural circuits in the brainstem (area postrema/nucleus of the solitary tract). This means it is more than just useful for preventing nausea; your brain responds less to ongoing inflammation/damage in the rest of the body. If inflammation is causing problems in the rest of the system via brainstem, as we expect in ME, cutting out that part of the circuit can allow homeostatic systems to right themselves as it leaves the system\n3/ higher dose aprepitant also inhibits neutral sphingomyelinase 2, a protein involved in production of cellular exosomes. Exosomes made by inflammatory cells can target other cells much like other secreted cytokines/chemokines, but these are protected from degradation and often can be potently pro-inflammatory; aprepitant is likely unique (so far) in its ability to reduce cytokines secreted by themselves and cytokines secreted in exosomes\nPEM:\nPEM is downstream of glutamate excitotoxicity -\nexertion → lactate, cytokines, ROS → glutamate, systemic inflammation → PEM\nherx to PEM:\nSo - herx reactions involve activation of toll like receptors (especially TLR4, the major receptor for bacterial endotoxin and DAMPs) and NLR family inflammasomes (especially the potent interleukin-1beta inducer, NLRP3) - this results in cytokine/chemokine release. Exertion can cause enough DAMP/cytokine production to trigger PEM itself\nThese signal to the brain (via area postrema, subfornical organ, and other areas) that you have to generate a sympathetic and neuro-immune response. These fail;\nEndothelial dysfunction (associated with eNOS uncoupling, reduced/increased neurotransmitters) means you cannot perfuse your brain properly\nNormally your vagus nerve fine tunes this immune response via reducing the activity of immune cells residing in the spleen. If this doesn’t happen, inflammation can persist when not required\nPro-resolving responses fail due to lack of substrate for SPM production (omega-3s), vagal dysfunction discussed above, nerve damage impairing neuro-immune interface in muscles and organs  (neurogenic inflammation, impairment of myelin repair/phagocytosis of damaged myelin, acetylcholine receptor or other antibodies), etc\nNeurons protect themselves from glutamate excitotoxicity by internalising glutamate receptors - I believe NMDARs are most important, this will require a lot of study to prove (I did discuss Kat’s theory and the evidence for this before)\n\nto refine my question above, why does glutamate excitotoxicity occur upon a cytokine/chemokine cascade from eg DAMPS or TLR4 activation?\n\nNo effective pro-resolving response\n/spike or other antigens in brain (or baseline inflammation which potentiates responses to cytokine stimulation)\nThe brain normally kicks into sympathetic drive to ensure you are delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues\nThis fails, tissues can’t generate energy effectively enough or get enough blood flow. Brain still thinks you are in danger\nYour brain senses somatic stress via cytokines and chemokines, it then induces changes in vagal function/neuromuscular/neuro-organ interface/sympathetic activity to control the rest of the body\nSo, your brain is failing to control the rest of the body’s response to inflammation because of the above factors\nIt may be something as simple as redox stress impairing pro-resolving response, which explains why people with  mild LC just need gigadose anti-oxidants\nBut yeah - there is a brain/body mismatch. Body is signalling it is stressed, brain keeps responding to try and induce correct responses. They don’t happen (or, happen extremely slowly)\nSo, the body will keep signalling it is stressed to the brain. More cytokines/chemokines\nThese induce glutamate excitotoxicity via several mechanisms - the major one is microglial activation\nActivated microglia internalise GLT-1 and GLAST, glutamate transporters - this increases extracellular glutamate\nEventually, consistent microglial activation/blood brain barrier damage secondary to cytokines and chemokines causes excitotoxicity - NMDARs on neurons internalise to counteract this as a protective mechanism, but this changes how they signal. An example;\nWhen you took NC GABA during PEM, you had already internalised NMDARs, causing PEM/inability to exert without immense cognitive effort. The glutamate/GABA signalling ratio gets skewed towards GABA\nYou take the GABA and that shifts more. You feel more tranquillized and heavy\nThis flip allows microglia and neurons to take a break. Glia start mopping up glutamate again as they increase GLT-1/GLAST expression; NMDARs start coming back to the cell surface\nThese NMDARs can be hypersensitive when low in number, so there is risk of recapitulation\nOtherwise - glia start to take up glutamate all of a sudden and make a lot of glutamine (burns, tinnitus, increased ICP, etc when happening rapidly)\nBut the neuron function starts to return to normal\nHowever - if microglia stay activated, glutamate is going to be sitting in extracellular space, you can stay in PEM for as long as it takes for them to quiet down\nsensory (noise/light) sensitivity:\nSensory sensitivity relies upon a few different things - I will use light sensitivity as an example\nLight (like any other stressor) can induce an excitatory response in brain regions associated with the processing of sensory information - when hyperexcited, this can cause increased glutamate signalling and microglial activation (especially so when combined with BBB dysfunction/prior insult making certain areas of the brain hypersensitive)\nThis is especially well researched in epilepsy - light is a well known trigger of attacks, there can be an extraordinarily fast response\nHowever - this process can also happen slowly over time. Any sensory stressor can activate the amygdala and also modulate global CNS function by this means - amygdala/frontal lobe axis becomes rather important here when considering the brain fog/executive dysfunction which swiftly follows once a sensory input threshold is reached\nGenerally this should be protective - your brain is telling you to avoid what it cannot deal with - however your frontal lobe is not responding as expected due to hypoperfusion\nThis explains why people have a total capacity for sensory stimulus and also separate ones - they can deal with so much input before amygdala signals “fuck no, get me the hell out of here” to other brain regions\nSome inputs will stimulate the amygdala more so than others - if you can’t close your pupils as rapidly as you should, for whatever reason; or, if you have optic nerve or (especially) occipital lobe inflammation which primes them to be hyperexcitable, then you will respond a hell of a lot more to light. If inflammation is in specific cranial nerves or parts of the brain which deal with olfactory or auditory processing, physical pain/emotional pain, etc., then you will hyperrespond to the corresponding stimuli\nHyperactivation of the amygdala itself can precipitate microglial activation there, which has knock on effects. An example;\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7394753/\nIf you prevent microglial activation in the amygdala of stressed rats, they no longer get abdominal pain from stress\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10927919/\nMicroglial activation in amygdala can result from moderate but consistent noise exposure in mice\nrapamycin:\nThe school of thought which was supported by Dr Mikhail Blagosklonny (rip) and friends was that mTOR hyperfunction in aging causes immune dysfunction and immunosuppression. Dialling mTOR function back into the normal range boosts the immune system\nI am a strong supporter of this theory in respect to aging and chronic disease. I believe that rapamycin dosage is absolutely critical - this is why I brought up the generic form before, knowing how much one absorbs is also incredibly important\nIf you dose over what is needed, it is easy to immunosuppress yourself. Not all tissues absorb rapa the same - rapamycin likes fat, so can be higher concentration in adipose tissue/lungs/kidney\nInflammatory pressure results in mTOR hyperfunction. For example, ativation of the cell survival pathway (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) in T cells usually prevents their exhaustion by regulating the T-cell exhaustion associated proteins (PD-1); however, mTOR hyperfunction can lead to exhaustion via production of cytokines and growth factors/bystander activation and induction of CTLA-4 (exhaustion marker)\nSo, it is the chronic activation of mTOR and the resulting dysfunction which drives the issues, rather than the direct impact of mTOR function on exhaustion markers\nIt is slightly different in everyone. There are different mechanisms by which T cells can be exhausted, there are different mutations being carried (ADGRE2 is an excellent example here) which means different cells are at different ‘baselines’ of function\nSome people do not respond well to rapa as certain subsets of immune cells could already have mTOR suppressed by other factors (TGF-beta can do this). There is a strange relationship between TGF-beta and mTOR related functions - TGF-beta can drive fibrotic disease processes in inflammatory conditions. Rapamycin has been found to be useful in liver fibrosis, but not lung (where perhaps metformin, aprepitant would be)\nTGF-beta:\nTGF-beta usually plays a protective role in cell functions, protects against inflammation causing damage via fibrosis/prevents cancerous transformation of cells\ntranslational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5876-10-183\nHowever, once it escapes control of inflammatory and other factors (often due to cellular changes to TGF/SMAD pathway), it can promote the stuff it would normally protect you from\nMany people with ME also have the classical mold related illness mycotoxin or environmental toxin sensitivity phenotype - their symptoms certainly seem to be driven by Bisphenol A, dioxins, ochratoxins etc activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor → TGF-beta signalling\nTGF-beta usually protects against autoimmunity via upregulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) www.nature.com/articles/s41419-018-1107-7\nGuess what happens if you have environmental toxins/mycotoxin exposure? Attempts to protect oneself against autoimmunity will increase your sensitivity to these toxins\npeptides:\nSometimes BPC-157 isn’t even needed if you target gut properly, fixing microbiome and supporting gut with PQQ is sometimes enough - or rarely, BPC-157 doesn’t work because of SIBO/gut dysbiosis. Good quality microbiome tests can help you figure out what the best plan of action is. Rarely, people have D-lactate acidosis - D-lactate is produced by pathogenic bacteria, and cannot be metabolised; this can build up to toxic levels. Ruling this out can be useful, and some microbiome tests look at D-lactate\nI think an excellent peptide to use if you can get a good source is elamipretide, SS-31\nx-peptides are excellent from what I have heard\nelamipretide/SS-31:\nThere is some risk of side effects; because of the weird dose response curve, often it is best to go straight for the high dose rather than attempting to taper up\nI don’t believe there is an interaction with the ProdromeGlia, however elamipretide is not studied well enough for me to be sure - I can see if there is literature on elamipretide effects on beta adrenergic receptors\nSS-31 is something useful to pulse for a while whilst you try fix vascular/lymphatic issues\npathogenesis summary:\nI think there are so many ways to get there - it can be a direct injury to hypothalamus/brainstem by infection or whiplash. It can be an systemic immune system disorder where mast cells/T cells/macrophages infiltrate brain parenchyma. It can be something like May-Thurner or limited tissue/organ hypoxia causing a somatic stress syndrome via production of GDF15 (morning sickness in pregnancy/hyperemesis gravidarum and post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting are excellent non-ME examples of these)\nit can be a long term chronic infection in gut, sinuses, blood, lung, peripheral nervous system; it can be a combination of these, or a combination of these with trauma\nIn rare cases, it can be a genetic disorder which is uncovered or genetic issue which is not a disease entity; methylation issues, mitochondrial disorders, glycogen storage diseases\nSometimes it is liver disease - especially bile duct disease/biliary cholangitis. Even rarer are cancers with associated paraneoplastic syndromes\nA systemic vascular problem and/or issue with iron homeostasis could cause limited hypoxia systemically, especially in extremities and with microclots → somatic stress via TGF-beta1/GDF15, and also cause hypoperfusion of CNS. So there is an argument for trying to improve cardiovascular system first. Sulodexide or rhamnan sulfate seem to work best in people with severe vascular issues .\nGut/liver/brain axis gets messed up;\nCan be gut dysbiosis → endotoxemia, MCAS → brainstem inflammation. The area postrema (in brainstem) is the only part of brain outside blood-brain barrier; it gets information on inflammatory and metabolic processes and relays that to the solitary tract. The area postrema can be full of mast cells in neurological disorders, including ME\nThe gut can mostly be fine, and metabolic issues are the major problem; the area postrema also responds to incretins like GLP-1/GIP/glucagon. If metabolic issues get out of hand, the liver becomes mildly insufficient - especially important if urea cycle is impaired. Urea cycle is impaired by mast cells, so also important in previous example; loss of urea cycle components due to TCA cycle problems is also contributing\nThis pressures the brain itself as there is more toxic ammonia in CNS and glutamine production from glutamate and ammonia\nNeurological inflammation messes up lymphatic drainage from CNS, which creates it’s own world of problems\nSometimes (I believe) it can be GDF15 acting at area postrema to induce mast cell activity there. Increased sensitivity to GDF15 because of MCAS results in increased nausea/vomiting/malaise response to GDF15\nIt could be persistent virus - some people get better after antivirals. Some people get better after targeting spike/biofilm with natto. Often, these people try the other option beforehand and it doesn’t work\nCells run of out energy → they ‘panic’, and release stuff like GDF15/FGF21, cytokines and other indicators of ‘somatic stress’ to the brain. Brain is already inflamed, so hyperresponds\nweak links:\nPeople have particular issues because they have a weak link in the chain. For example, ~ 30% of people in RB who have had genes tested are carriers for glycogen storage diseases. Population carrier rate is less than 2%\nOne lady whose genes I tore apart - they had carboxypeptidase N deficiency causing complement hyperactivity, with chemerin receptor mutation indicating impaired pro-resolving capacity since birth\nSo this person has issues with bradykinin, complement and pro-fibrotic cytokines like CXCL12, which fit with their symptoms\nThe problem is that this is extraordinarily time consuming, and it would be difficult for me to prove my findings without considerable research $\nCNS inflammation as root cause?\nIn my opinion, ME or LC are at their root central nervous system inflammatory disorders with metabolic/infectious components\nAn inappropriate response to exercise/stress results from an inability for the brain to control the major organs, along with mineral/vitamin deficiencies and immunosuppression resulting from long term immune activation,\nThe brain is essentially shutting down the body as it is under too much stress. This can be as a result of any stressor, hypoxic stress is particularly important in those with ADHD\nSo endothelial dysfunction can drive CNS dysfunction, which causes systemic inflammation. Which is what I would consider your phenotype to be\nYou have some CNS pathology also, which we need to single out - could be spike, could be Borrelia, could be something else\nWhen they named it myalgic encephalomyelitis, they got it mostly right. Muscle pain, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord\nI strongly believe the prerequisite for ME/neuro LC is brainstem/hypothalamic/midbrain dysfunction (secondary to or worsened by infection), which can be exacerbated by clonal mast cells but also by other factors that all interact - blood flow, spike protein persistence, neurotransmitters, mast cells, cytokines and growth factors, microglial activation, complement activation, astroglia and lymphatics and their role in glymphatic drainage; many of these are interconnected, and many people display deficits in different areas dependent of their pathogen or toxin load/genetics etc\nEndothelial inflammation as root cause?\nI believe severe endothelial dysfunction is also downstream of the CNS problems, and not just as a result of direct endothelial activation by spike. A number of pathogens which do not cause severe endothelial inflammation or damage but which can infect the CNS (echoviruses, enteroviruses, herpesviruses) can cause ME. [Endothelial inflammation in ME] usually as a result of B cell overactivity rather than direct infection causing endotheliitis (in EBV)\nUsing this example - many people without LC/ME are getting vascular damage from COVID and are not noticing. They won’t notice until 10-30 years down the line when they have a heart attack, or stroke\nI believe the reason we notice everything is because we have the central nervous system manifestions also\nDirect vascular inflammation can result from endotoxemia/gut problems, or immune activation - however one would normally to terminate systemic inflammatory responses via brain → vagus → spleen and other mechanisms\nSo the fact that there is endothelial inflammation is not the cause of ME - the presence of microclots doesn’t mean this person has ME or LC. Kell/Pretorius found amyloid fibrinaloids in stroke patients clots\nredox stress/ROS:\ncan’t fix endothelial dysfunction without getting redox stress under control\nYou deplete your vitamin C/E, glutathione, etc slowly over time - inflammation causes redox stress as immune cells are activated and they produce ROS to kill pathogens. So, cytokines like TNF-alpha etc can contribute to ROS production\nmitochondria can be dysfunctional and produce ROS (via complex I) - NADPH oxidases can also contribute to ROS production also\nEssentially we make ROS to regulate our own systems at a low level. We make lots of ROS (especially intracellularly, or in a fashion where it is released by neutrophils or other immune cells) as a way to target pathogens\nIf one is inflamed, the immune activation results in increased ROS generation\nAdd on the mitochondrial issues (complexes I and III  can produce ROS when mitochondria are damaged) and the other enzymes which produce ROS under inflammatory pressure, this likely constitutes an important part of the puzzle in your case\nNADPH oxidases and mitochondrial complexes (likely I, maybe III) are definitely involved in yourself\nI have inferred complex I issues from your response to NADH\nEndoplasmic reticulum stress is also very likely, given severity - plays an important role in neuroinflammatory conditions\nXanthine oxidase is always functional, amount of ROS generated isn’t usually worrisome unless redox homeostasis is already messed up\nSomewhat, yes - however we want them to produce ROS locally when they are killing shit. You don’t want ROS circulating in system or damaging mitochondria\nantioxidants:\nAh, I forgot about why I have been harping on about anti-oxidants - there is a molecule known as asymmetric dimethylarginine which can build up and inhibit NO production. The enzyme which metabolises this is very sensitive to ROS inhibiting it\naka ADMA\nADMA inhibits eNOS\nI like using several different antioxidants - there is a phenomenon where anti-oxidants (vitamin C, uric acid most discussed in literature) at high concentrations actually have pro-oxidant qualities\nUsing multiple anti-oxidants therefore it likely to have a ‘buffering’ effect. This is yet to be described in literature, as far as I know - am keen to study at some point\nPycnogenol is a decent anti-oxidant - you could try add in the carnitine, then another anti-oxidant (maybe mitoQ/PQQ/glutathione/NAC/other antioxidant, am thinking), then the sildenafil\nTaking omega-3 when in a inflammatory state can mean you are going to oxidise them yourself - so, taking a few different anti-oxidants to “spare” the omega 3 is best way forward, I believe\nmithochondrial cytopathy:\nMitochondrial cytopathy is supposedly constant, however there can be fluctuations\nOther mitochondrial diseases do not result in PEM. I strongly believe the dysfunction is central (in ME)\nbrainfog/brain burns:\nThis is not common, about 1/20 people I speak to with LC/ME have it (if I am remembering correctly)\nI could offer multiple different reasons - could be increased intracranial pressure, or ammonia toxicity due to urea cycle dysfunction; borrelia could play a role, with or without replication competent virus or left behind spike in meninges; could be that you already have a disrupted blood brain barrier/gut microbiome and that your immune system is more hyperactive as a result.  could be autoimmunity, could be impaired glymphatic drainage; many of these do not exclude the others\nSome people with ADHD/ASD get burning head when overstimulated; this was known even pre- COVID\nWhat can be said for sure is that glutamate/GABA balance is messed up\nBrain burning makes me think lymphangiogenesis could be messed up\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7956141/\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention to you - eNOS controls lymphatic system, so eNOS uncoupling could be contributing to poor lymphatic drainage also\nAmmonia can negatively impact lymphangiogenesis; this study tested humans and rats with hepatic encephalopathy, improving lymphangiogenesis decreases microglial activation\noverview1:\nI am thinking of a couple different things -\nBrain burns are secondary to dopamine failing to control cerebrovascular tone via eNOS/reduced dopamine\nReduced dopaminergic tone in PAG and/or inflammation of periaqueductal grey, leading to PAG dysfunction and potential pain sensitization (do you get severe pain elsewhere, or just head?)\nMeningeal hypersensitivity secondary to disrupted blood flow/dopamine and potential spike deposits\nPEM, tingly arms, executive failure = dopamine issues?\nThis seems like low dopamine, more than anything else\nI think this is at least partially low dopamine ‘action paralysis’, but the motor version rather than the sensory or cognitive versions\nPEM groups:\nThere are two major types of PEM I see in people - either they feel poisoned, often extra pain, fluey, sometimes stiff/crampy. Luteolin/rutin/curcumin as BDMC/LDN/metformin/diamox or other treatments which target CNS well work in this group\nOr, they feel plugged out of socket - they don’t feel poisoned or extremely unwell, they just can’t function. Some still get cramps and stiffness, but unless they are super severe they can get something from their desk or go to and from bathroom and back with extra effort. They often find it difficult to initiate action (‘action paralysis’), dopaminergics often work better in this group\nI feel you are a bit of both, more group 2\nglutamate excitotoxicity:\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7761728/\nWhen covid spike/bacterial LPS/endogenous ‘DAMPs’ like fibronectin, HMGB1/fungal cell wall constituents like mannan activate TLR4 in the central nervous system, then you end up with impaired glutamate clearance by astrocytes and microglia\nGlia have the glutamate transporters EAAT1/EAAT2 (GLAST, GLT-1) - when these glutamate transporters are downregulated, the glia cannot clear glutamate from the extracellular space fast enough, causing excitotoxicity\nGLT-1 can be downregulated by classical inflammatory factors, but also by ammonia - for example, GLT-1 is downregulated in hepatic encephalopathy, causing glutamate excitotoxicity\nTLR4 connection:\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7761728/\nTLR4 signalling induces glutamate production - and, eventually, an decrease in the ability of microglia to take up glutamate\nThis leads to excess glutamate in synaptic cleft → excitotoxicity\nNMDA receptors internalise afterwards; calcium levels in cells get too high, calmodulin/clathrin are involved in ‘endocytosing’ or internalising receptors as a protective mechanism\nWe believe this internalisation causes PEM\nAmmonia inhibits glutamate uptake by glia, which contributes to excitotoxicity also\nhead/intracranial pressures:\nHigh intracranial pressure results from poor glymphatic drainage, swollen brain tissue, etc\nSkull only has so much space inside it and isn’t flexible, so eventually pressure can build to dangerous levels if there is inflammatory pathology. This can result in neurological damage and/or CSF leaks\nHigh intracranial pressure results from poor glymphatic drainage, swollen brain tissue, etc\nSkull only has so much space inside it and isn’t flexible, so eventually pressure can build to dangerous levels if there is inflammatory pathology. This can result in neurological damage and/or CSF leaks\nProblems with vision are usually a major hallmark of raised ICP, as is papilledema (optic disc swelling) which can be seen during eye exams\nUnfortunately for many with ME, we believe they can have raised ICP without the classical signs - vision can be spared until ICP becomes particularly severe, papilledema is not always apparent and especially so in ME/LC\nI was talking about glutamine causing brain edema before with you\nLOLA may be dealing with ammonia, but the conversion into glutamine may increase your ICP\nGlutamine may not be getting cleared because of sluggish glymphatic drainage\nIdeally we improve your glymphatic drainage. Rutin with LOLA could be a first port of call\nAh, you have access to a pharmacy - could try sodium phenylbutyrate\nPhenylbuytrate gets converted to phenylacetate, which conjugates with glutamine\nHowever improving glymphatic drainage is required here imo\n\ncan liver/kidney panels show urea cycle impairment?\n\nNo - would need to look at urea cycle intermediates\nglymphatic drainage:\nGlymphatic drainage is to process of your glial cells and lymphatic system working together to clear your CNS. Inflammation usually triggers this process; like with blood vessels, lymphatic vessels can be produced (lymphangiogenesis) to help increase glymphatic drainage\nNow this system can be damaged at several points of the chain\nThe astroglia themselves can damaged so that they cannot take up toxins etc as well; the lymphatic system can fail to respond properly via lymphangiogenesis, and/or eNOS uncoupling or other factors can result in lymphatic system being sluggish\nReduced blood flow can potentiate issues, however there are multiple factors at play yes\nGABA:\nThere is another thing I am thinking about, and will research over the next 24 hours - some GABA neurons actually promote excitatory functions by being ‘double-inhibitory’ - by inhibiting neurons which inhibit other neurons, a third neuron type is allowed to perform its excitatory function. So GABA will have complex effects once in CNS dependent on area and neuron targeted\nThis partially explains the colloquial ‘valium rage’ or paradoxical excitability when using benzodiazepines. I have read enough into this before that I shouldn’t need too much more\nIf it is making you worse during PEM, then you took it on the downswing (glutamate receptors internalise, GABA dominates; causing PEM/tranquillized feeling)\nIt is likely taking GABAergics during PEM can make stuff worse, but it acts as a useful preventative\nI have seen a similar phenomenon before, Kat has also mentioned it - taking rutin/fisetin during PEM does this, some people get unusual responses to benzos which somewhat mirror this\nnicergoline &lt;&gt; guanfacine:\nnicergoline reduces adrenergic signalling by blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors\nGuanfacine reduces it by activating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors (so, in instances where there is low noradrenaline, this is great) - activation of alpha-2 receptors by noradrenaline or guanfacine usually results in termination of fight/flight response\nSometimes, there aren’t enough A2ARs, and/or enough NA\nadrenergic/sympathetic issues as potential cause (autism?):\nnicergoline worked to reduce brainfog symptoms somewhat. it is an alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonist\nSo, (nor)adrenaline activates your alpha-1 adrenoreceptor - this mediates many of the the classical effects of adrenaline\nThe alpha 2 adrenoreceptor is involved in terminating the sympathetic response - so nicergoline, clonidine, guanfacine etc reduce sympathetic activity - just by different mechanisms\nThe sympathetic response should be self-terminating via alpha-2 adrenoreceptor - that can fail to happen for multiple reasons\nMight be worth trying clonidine? Usually puts ADHD types to sleep\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8950318/ Adrenaline activates eNOS\neNOS is uncoupled, so consistent adrenaline release/sympathetic response is telling your blood vessels to produce NO (nitric oxide) and this fails - lots of ROS is produced instead\nAdrenaline is therefore failing to function properly and is causing other additional issues via ROS generation\nNormally, if one was a 60 year old gentleman with classical cardiovascular disease, there would be some element of sympathetic hyperactivity which drives pathology via eNOS uncoupling. In ME, this is happening alongside severe mitochondrial dysfunction/inability to quality control mitochondria\neNOS is also expressed in mitochondria, so eNOS uncoupling is particularly devastating for persons with ME\nNormally, one would be able to terminate fight/flight response quickly. In persons with ME/LC (also ADHD, autism, etc) this mechanism is faulty - this means that eNOS uncoupling doesn’t cause mild cardiovascular disease that takes years to become apparent, but rather we already have CNS hypoperfusion which usually benefits from adrenaline - once we stop benefiting from adrenaline for perfusion during chronic sympathetic activity, the loss of function is significant\n\ni guess what i don’t understand if the endothelial dysfunction kicks off the the sympathetic/adrenergic hyperactivity, or the other way around?\n\nCould be CNS inflammation, somatic stressors signaling to the brain; could be hyperarousal, even bright light will cause sympathetic response in severe ME patients\nMany people can’t listen to music - same process. Many people have sympathetic activity from any number of things - reactions to food are especially awkward\nPeople can be in the situation where they aren’t using any extra energy but sympathetic activation can make them crash - some in RB crash after getting bad news or having charged conversations\nvascular issue causes:\nNo - POTS means nervous system cannot control vasculature effectively, can be at the level of brain/(vagus) nerve/endothelia itself\nfluid homeostasis issues (especially hypovolemia) can exist alongside POTS and eNOS uncoupling. Mitochondrial cytopathy in kidney can cause limited dysfunctions, the best known being Fanconi syndrome\nhypovolemia:\nI think you have low blood volume, rather than salt improving cortisol levels\nMild hypovolemia almost always goes unnoticed\nHypovolemia doesn’t mean low blood volume, but rather low extracellular fluid volume\nLow BP, low body temperature, dizziness/nausea, tiredness, thirst\nIt could contribute towards PEM by creating orthostatic stress - nervous system signalling to blood vessels is impaired, so one cannot make the right adaptations fast enough\neNOS uncoupling:\nVascular inflammation (with low BH4?) causing eNOS uncoupling makes most sense as a primary mechanism\nEspecially as you have Borrelia - you will likely have have monocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells and neutrophils involved in vascular inflammation\nClassically, eNOS uncoupling does not accompany POTS, it is something that happens more as one ages, or especially so if someone has cardiovascular disease\nNADH using up BH4:\nMy current theory;\npubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi702243b\nNADH can activate mitochondrial complex I, creating ROS you can’t detoxify because of impaired redox status\nwww.researchgate.net/figure/A-simplified-scheme-of-the-interplay-between-BH4-and-ni-tric-oxide-synthase-NOS-to_fig3_46287663\nYou take the NADH; at first, all is well. NADH + BH2 creates NAD+ and BH4, eNOS is recoupled. Symptoms improve, mitochondria have fuel.\nUnfortunately, mitochondrial function cannot be sustained without excessive ROS production - ROS will reduce cellular BH4 to BH2. You are back where you started, but worse because you are under greater redox stress\nThis redox stress may damage mitochondria directly. Maybe antioxidants are required with NADH, and maybe a slower taper\nI did not expect this to happen. NAD+ would not have this problem, I am assuming? (Going to clarify this once I read more)\nNADH activating mast cells:\nFound another possible cause for an unusual response to NADH - more BH4 might actually make mast cells more reactive\nNAD+:\nSo, you have a limited pool of NAD+ because\n1/ complex I can run in reverse (RET) instead of forwards, making NADH from NAD+ (instead of the usual, making NAD+ from NADH) - this causes oxidative stress itself\n2/ NAD+ can be consumed to produce NAM (by PARPs, sirtuins, other enzymes responding to DNA damage and inflammation) - this NAM (nicotinamide, not niacinamide) now needs to be salvaged via NAMPT\nUnfortunately, NAMPT gets inhibited by inflammatory stimulus, so less NAD+ is being made via the salvage pathway\n￼\nThe problem isn’t necessarily conversion of the precursors they gave you\nIt is rather than the NAD+ pool is too small because of continued inflammation and impaired salvage of nicotinamide\nNADH doesn’t deplete your NAD+ pool, it just makes your NADH/NAD+ ratio less tolerable\nNADH doesn’t deplete NAD+\nIt does make NADH/NAD+ ratio less tolerable\nIt shouldn’t make the ratio less tolerable, NADH should be consumed by complex I to produce NAD+. Complex I is inefficient due to damage\nPeroxynitrite can specifically damage complex I. There can be damage to mitochondrial DNA, cardiolipin, or other integral parts of the mitochondria\nThere is likely a genetic component, where some people have a complex I which is more vulnerable to damage/more active iNOS to produce oxidative species\nRemember extracellular NAD+ sets of Naviaux’s CDR response via P2X receptors\n[NC NAD+] Would be an unbelievable way to point out Naviaux’s theory only holds completely true in specific situations\nchatgpt.com/share/67cef4b9-f8e4-800e-b792-9b2a23565560\nExtracellular NAD+ is going to be converted to NMN/NAM/nicotinamide/nicotinamide mononucleotides. Will require magnesium and ATP to convert back to NAD+, and functional NAD+ biosynthesis enzymes\nHas to be liposomal at a minimum if NAD+ biosynthesis is messed up yeah\nAssuming magnesium isn’t a major issue for you\nheat sensitivity:\nThose with NLRP3 overactivity get the worst heat intolerance\nI know someone who is extremely severe. Their mother has cold induced urticaria; this person has severe heat intolerance. Their bedroom is 15-16 degrees Celsius at all times, any warmer is too much for them\nThese kind of cases scream cyropyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS)\nHeat intolerance of other kinds which appear after a significant hit like COVID infection is likely to be associated with ADGRE2 or other gene mutations which result in NLRP3 overactivity\nSo, we need to think NLRP3 for yourself as well\nHowever, heat intolerance is a big clue as to how cryopyrin (NLRP3) is functioning\nWell, this means anakinra/canakinumab is likely to cure them, at least\nIL-1beta receptor* targeting mAb\nProblem being these are highly immunosuppressive, and she has to survive current infx also\nColchicine would be useful for most here but wouldn’t be tolerated by her most likely\nSome people are allergic to colchicine. Rolling dice here is not recommended\nZileuton might be useful. I will think about this\nThere is a plant (Rabdosia rubescens) which produces a direct NLRP3 inhibitor, oridonin\nfinding root cause is hard, treatment philosophy:\nSometimes one cannot remove the root cause - especially as Borrelia/Toxoplasma etc are exceptionally crafty and can evade parts of the immune system via different methods\nI am assuming that the combination of autism and Borrelia means finding something to improve blood flow to brain may not work perfectly - sometimes improving blood flow to inflamed brain can exacerbate issues, more vascular space means less intracranial space for brain itself; additionally, pressuring eNOS to function here means more available ROS\nAs a result, reducing central nervous system inflammation itself is required alongside other interventions. What I am looking to do is improve vascular function without forcing eNOS to function heavily, whilst reducing CNS inflammation in case increased blood flow is problematic\nsulfates:\nSo there is an argument for trying to improve cardiovascular system first. Sulodexide or rhamnan sulfate seem to work best in people with severe vascular issues\nPeople are spending hundreds of dollars on supplements with sulfate in - Arterosil is what some people use. The source they use for rhamnan sulfate is the seaweed (eaten in Japan) Monostroma nitidum. Ulva pertusa (also eaten in Japan) is another excellent source. Both of these are about 10% rhamnan sulfate by dry weight. So you can pick up a large bag of edible seaweed for 5 euro with the same amount of rhamnan sulfate as a $100 bottle of Arterosil .\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961222005051 (RS and reduced plaque/vascular inflammation)\nwww.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92459-7 (improves gut at only 100mg a day)\nlink.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11418-019-01289-5 (heparin like anti-coagulant activity)\nPotentially the seaweed is better than sulodexide\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8707894/\nI will see if I can find the right stuff\nThe idea is that one might incorporate rhamnan sulfate into their vascular endothelium, like other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) - if so, it may act as an anti-viral which persists in the vasculature. Which would be absolutely incredible\nIt should at a minimum improve vascular function\nSaw it make a big impact in the life of someone (woman in 50s) with LC and heart disease - leg claudications went away, they could walk with minimal pain (when it used to be extreme) and could recover much faster\nProject leader of RB uses sulodexide instead, is cheaper\nSulodexide is heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. These and rhamnan sulfate are sulfated glycosaminoglycans, which are all being studied in cardiovascular disease\nsulodexide vs rhamnan sulfate:\nWe don’t know which is best, unfortunately - we plan to trial this at some point soon\nImportantly - we don’t know if glycocalyx restoration by sulodexide can be mimicked somewhat by the rhamnan sulfate. RS is similar enough to dermatan and heparan sulfates to consider this\nIf not, sulodexide is probably better\nArterosil could be better than the Monostroma nitidum/Ulva pertusa, partially because the processing makes the rhamnan sulfate more bioavailable. I am not entirely sure what the fruit extracts in arterosil consist of, if they are just flavonoid extractions or something else - assumption is that these could be replaced by grape seed extract/sumac/rutin etc\nsharp gut pain:\nonions are a source of sulfur. hmm - maybe we have to think about hydrogen sulfide\nOnion activates eNOS!?!\nwww.eurekaselect.com/article/19894\nI am also thinking hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria could be a problem here. H2S also activates eNOS\nBiomesight should show if there is an overgrowth of Methanobrevibacter sp., however you could try target H2S with inhaled eucalyptol\nH2S is pro-inflammatory mostly via activation of the TRPA1 ion channel - eucalyptol blocks this\nh2s and hypoglycemia:\nMy guess right now is that H2S is inducing reactive hypoglycemia\nH2S can increase or decrease insulin sensitivity dependent on dose and location. I think there is more to it than this, however\nI am thinking about glycogen storage\nNO resistance and why sildenafil:\nNitric oxide resistance can result from intracellular (cGMP/PKG axis) dysfunction, which sildenafil targets directly\nI believe that the problem is either NO resistance, or BH4, or both\nIt can happen at multiple levels -\nSo, normally NO diffuses through the membrane to activate guanylate cyclase, which produces cyclic GMP to activate protein kinase G - this completes the signalling cascade\nNO deficiency/resistance can co-exist;\neNOS can be downregulated after uncoupling to protect vasculature, or uncoupling prevents NO production. If some NO is being produced, it can react with ROS to form the damaging peroxynitrite\nSo there is an element of each process when NO production is dysregulated\nIntracellularly - the guanylate cyclase itself can lose responsiveness to NO, so less cGMP is produced; or, cGMP can fail to activate protein kinase G\nSildenafil makes this cGMP/PKG axis more sensitive. Need to understand why that is the case before commenting\nSildenafil increases blood vessel sensitivity to NO\nYou will be producing some NO, not all eNOS would be uncoupled; some NO will be getting scavenged by O2• (superoxide) to form ONOO (peroxynitrite)\nNADPH oxidase is a major source of ROS which helps uncouple eNOS; sildenafil inhibits NADPH oxidases also, so in reality it may boost NO availability in certain tissues\n[SS-31] plus inhibition of NADPH oxidases by sildenafil should be enough of a dialling down of ROS to see a response, I -hope\nAAA risks:\nThat is fair. Research is pretty clear, sildenafil does increase AAA risk and progression\nNitric oxide itself drives AAA progression - so, eNOS uncoupling constitutes a protective mechanism despite the damage it can inflict otherwise via ROS generation\nI think I have changed my opinion on it\nWas thinking early sulodexide/RS usage would reduce the risk of the negative side effects we discussed\nAnd try to increase your L-carnitine and antioxidant intake before you try the sildenafil\nImproving vascular function first before using sildenafil is the minimum\nI can’t accurately gauge what the rates of AAAs or cerebrovascular aneurysms in the LC/ME communities are\nSildenafil is useful in the vast majority of situations - vasodilation increases cardiac workload however, and many people have reduced left ventricular ejection fraction - heart is not working efficiently. So, if you overshoot, the heart really has to work hard to keep up; heart has to perfuse itself also. This is most relevant when taking nitrates, vericiguat or other NO associated meds/supplements\nIn regard to aneurysms - nitric oxide or anything which increases sensitivity to NO can accelerate progression. didn’t know more than 1% of people have AAAs 🤯\n[wouldn’t the various sulfates also be dangerous for this reason?]\nNowhere near as potent as the meds mentioned above. They increase eNOS activity, rather than supplementing large amounts of substances which increase NO and/or increase sensitivity to NO\nThe major problem here is likely eNOS/nitric oxide here is the eNOS uncoupling and other factors leading to increased ROS generation and further NO scavenging. If we think in respect to AAAs, they form as a result of endothelial damage/shear stress, immune activation, elastin degradation - in ME, many people have reduced or increased renin-angiotensin signalling - Ang II levels are a major determinant of risk. Some with ME may have lower risk of AAAs because of reduced Ang II; others have ACE hyperfunction mutations which infer increased risk\n\nhow to fix if both NO boosting and NO sensitizing are potentially harmful?\n\nWe reduce the associated ROS generation, reduce immune activity/ inflammation via angiotensin II or other mediators - these contribute to vascular dysfunction also. If we improve redox, then adding NO back or increasing eNOS in any form becomes less risky\nHave been thinking about this in other supplements in the proposed ‘stack’; bromelain should reduce Ang II production, for example\nNo one thing will get you there by itself. We need to find the right combination that improves you and is tolerable\nface pain:\nThe trigeminal nerve nucleus is sat right deep in the brainstem with the other nuclei which we believe are usually inflamed in ME - solitary tract nucleus, dorsal motor vagal nucleus, etc\nIf you have worse facial pain and pressure when the brainstem itself is more inflamed, it is the nerves themselves that are inflamed\nMRI for neuroinflammation useful?\nThe reality is both of us know you have brainstem inflammation, getting docs to understand is a whole other thing.\nMRI is essential anyways - if brainstem or hypothalamic inflammation can’t be seen on T2 FLAIR images, getting gadolinium contrast images from there is a big risk. It is also only useful for convincing doctors you have brainstem inflammation - what are they going to do with this information which is likely to be hugely beneficial?\nI would say everyone with systemic issues, yeah - everyone moderate/severe, and most of the mild\nMRS/tracer risks:\nIs incredible technology, however you would be taking a radioactive substance to see how it is incorporated into neurotransmitters essentially\nSo you would be subjecting yourself to radioactivity and oxidative stress. Normally people could deal with this like they do when having radioactive iodine or other similar therapies/diagnostic tests, however you already have an issue with redox homeostasis, which makes this more risky for yourself\nliver:\nImproving liver function with L-ornithine and L-aspartate - making sure we know your methylation status - limonene capsules to induce phase I/II detoxification enzymes if you tolerate citrus\nCaraway seeds/caraway seed oil are a good alternative if citrus is not tolerated\nspike:\neither chronically via persistence, easily explained\nOr chronically via acute impact; immunosuppression/exhaustion by acute infection or during following weeks can allow pathogens to thrive. Spike can disappear over the years and the person stays sick\nWe talked about TLR4 earlier - should have been more specific. We don’t exactly know what spike can do, however we know TLR4 is required for neurological injury resulting from spike\nThere are multiple other proteins and other functions of spike we do not fully appreciate. S-CoV-2 (ORF8, iirc?) cleaves MAVS, which is critical for the interferon/mitochondrial response to pathogens\nThis is why I recommend bromelain, high dose natto/serra, trypsin and chymotrypsin\nMay be multiple proteins which need cleaving, not only spike\nI think functioning macrophages should be able to clear spike, and spike persistence in macrophages (this is where I respect Dr Patterson and team) is hugely problematic. Macrophages eat up S-CoV-2 or spike and dysregulate themselves.\nSo he [Patterson] is right in a certain sense, but technically incorrect when being expansive; I have found someone post-covid without spike in monocytes who is still ill\nspike hijacking cell metabolism:\nThere are internal toll like receptors like TLR3/7/8/9 - TLR3 is especially important here. TLR3 senses viral rna product poly I:C\nSo viruses activate intracellular immunity; unfortunately, the downstream members of interferon pathways are getting cleaved if live virus or many viral proteins reside there\nMany of these pathways act as positive feedback loops which can be activated extremely quickly, and are repressed by proteins which are in later stages of pathways - when these get messed up, the cells are stuck in pro-inflammatory mode - without MAVS and functional complement, they are attacking intracellular pathogens with feather dusters\nThese macrophages may not be able to sort out their own issues, but they do not exhaust like T cells do - they keep on producing pro-inflammatory factors which influence everything else around them\nTNF-alpha, IL-1beta activate loads of different cell types, including mast cells\nIL-4 and IL-13 we talked about before - these bias T cells towards Th2, these then activate mast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, B cells/dendritic cells producing IgE, and basophils supporting those B cells\nIL-4 does also activate mast cells directly I believe\nis spike always the cause?\nDoesn’t have to be virus\nThis is why I keep mentioning about all the stuff that activates TLR4 (bacteria, fungi, damage associated molecular patterns)\nThe virus and viral proteins can leave, and the pathology stays\nLots of these people with the very similar AI art are all associated with LCAP - they promote the idea that viral persistence is the be-all and end-all. I strenuously disagree\nviral persistence testing:\nThere are far more simple ways of looking for evidence of viral debris - one my good friend thought of was to look at ciliated cells (especially in ear/sensineural hearing loss, lung)\nS-CoV-2 ORF10 messes up the cell machinery to make cilia, and one can differentiate S-CoV-2 induced damage from something like influenza A\nOh yeah, it just would account for viral debris, but perhaps in a much cheaper way than using antibodies for S-CoV-2 proteins\nOh yeah, it would only really be a sensitive test for viable S-CoV-2 ORF10\nOne could differentiate direct damage to cell membrane (common in influenza A, neuraminidase cleaves cell membrane sialic acids), classical inflammation (which should increase ciliary beat frequency) and COVID (which will reduce ciliary beat frequency and cause cilia internalisation via ORF10 ubiquitin ligase)\nmast cells/MCs/MCAS:\nRupatadine is excellent as it is a dual H1 and platelet activating factor blocker\nMast cells make and release more PAF (without even needing to degranulate) when mTOR is more active\nFor many people, histamine is not the problem - unless one can prove that is the case with testing, anti-histamines and diamine oxidase (don’t use for long time, reduces your own production!), assume another mast cell mediator is more problematic\nEven then, it could be the case that H1 anti-histamines are working in people with somewhat normal histamine levels, and it is the reduced production of downstream leukotrienes/cytokines that is most relevant.\nA small number of people do report worsened fatigue in general after taking H1 or H2 blockers, and effects are additive - this lines up with above study. Blocking H1/H2 in these patients must be avoided, in my opinion\nTargeting monocyte activation would also calm mast cells/neutrophils etc\nThere may be some causality, however mast cell populations can acquire mutations after infection which cause clonal MC to arise; clonal MCs are not a prerequisite for ME/LC\nI strongly believe the prerequisite for ME/neuro LC is brainstem/hypothalamic/midbrain dysfunction (secondary to or worsened by infection), which can be exacerbated by clonal mast cells but also by other factors that all interact - blood flow, spike protein persistence, neurotransmitters, mast cells, cytokines and growth factors, microglial activation, complement activation, astroglia and lymphatics and their role in glymphatic drainage; many of these are interconnected, and many people display deficits in different areas dependent of their pathogen or toxin load/genetics etc\nBBB permeability:\nBBB permeability can be a negative when regarding anti-histamines. Long term use of BBB permeable anti-histamines can impact memory and other functions - this is usually most apparent in people who are elderly, but can apply in chronically sick\nI generally advise to minimise disruption of histamine in the brain whenever possible. However, if MCAS is severe, then ketotifen is definitely worth trying - I advise trying rupatadine if possible first, as it doesn’t cross BBB much in healthy adults (and may pass through slightly when BBB is damaged; difficult to know without direct study)\nHistamine is often unfairly maligned. It has pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions, and is critical (via H1 and H2 receptors) for optimal mitochondrial function\nAlso, the area of the brain most filled with mast cells, the area postrema, is the only part of the brain that sits outside the blood brain barrier\nhistamine may not be all bad, especially in the brain - where it is an important regulator of other neurotransmitters - but also peripherally as it (usually) bolsters mitochondrial biogenesis. If histamine (and everything else) functions properly, it should induce production of pro-resolving factors - the failure of the pro-resolution phase here is more important to assess than focusing just on histamine.\n(some neurons themselves are histaminergic. histamine in the brain has an incredible number of functions - many people do report H1 blockers worsen memory and brain fog)\ninappropriate MCET formation:\nit could be likely that there is inappropriate formation of mast cell extracellular traps during events which can also cause degranulation - the inflammation induced by MCETs can be more sustained than by degranulation journals.aai.org/jimmunol/article/187/1/490/86324/Mast-Cells-and-Neutrophils-Release-IL-17-through\nexcellent example here, psoriasis is not caused by Th17 cell derived IL-17; but rather mast cells and neutrophils which are producing extracellular traps\nThe reality is likely that ‘mast cell activation syndrome’, like long COVID, is four hundred chipmunks in a trench coat\nPeople might have clonal MCAS where there is a subpopulation of hyperresponsive MCs which are hyperresponsive in different ways. Or, rather, MCs are just responding to pathogens which aren’t supposed to be there, and rather forms of limited immunodeficiency are causative\ninflammatory resolvins:\n\n\ninflammation is initiated by viral proteins/LPS/mold exposure/etc. prostaglandins, leukotrienes, TNF-alpha, IL-beta, IL-6, CXCL8 (aka IL-8), histamine, bradykinin, platelet activating factor, thromboxanes, fibronectin, etc all play a role in orchestrating the inflammatory response\n\n\nall of these pro-inflammatory molecules have corresponding pro-resolving mediators which they induce to curb hyper-function. For example, histamine induces Resolvin E1 production (made from EPA) to counter its own pro-inflammatory effects, as does platelet activating factor. Other pro-inflammatory molecules induce other pro-resolving mediators, dependent on cell type\n\n\npro-resolution either works great, or it doesn&#039;t. Perhaps there is too much background inflammation, or there is long term depletion of omega-3s by oxidative stress/cell damage, or important enzymes/proteins are deprived of manganese, zinc, magnesium, selenium, etc \n\n\n\nManganese is especially important as it is in SOD3 (MnSOD), magnesium counteracts neurogenic inflammation, selenium (transported in selenoproteins) are important to maintain redox homeostasis, etc\n\n\nThis is oversimplified, but I shall try and get the major points across -\nThe problem isn’t that there is inflammation - we expect there to be inflammation. The problem is that it doesn’t resolve\nWhen you block certain pro-inflammatory factors, you also block the pro-resolving response. If the pro-resolving response is absent or impaired, then fair enough - using receptor antagonists of pro-inflammatory molecules is fine. However, if there is a functional pro-resolving response, blocking the receptor doesn’t yield major benefit\nalso, inflammation can be mediated by any number of different factors. I named a few, I am sure you can appreciate there are 40+ interleukins/hundreds of cytokines and chemokines - if we want to properly manage disease, we need to focus at the early steps before inflammation is initiated\nIf we think about the cardinal symptom of ME (PEM) as a failure of the pro-resolving response to exercise, it becomes way easier to explain what is going on\nkey:\n\nif we want to properly manage disease, we need to focus at the early steps before inflammation is initiated\n\nInstead of taking with food and having it absorb at once, which can cause blood sugar/metabolic functions to fluctuate (especially as there are two insulin spikes after meals often), taking afterwards would slow absorption whilst ensuring you absorb a large amount of it. Should be more tolerable, in my estimation\nSPMs should improve insulin sensitivity. Might be interesting to see what happens with the combination\nWell - glucose uptake is likely impaired, partially via reduced AMPK activation - reduced AMPK also negatively impacts mitochondrial biogenesis\nSPMs activate AMPK (and PPARs) to modulate inflammation and increase mitochondrial biogenesis. They should help you uptake more glucose into cells whilst improving mitochondrial OXPHOS function - one has to do both at once\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938427/\nThis paper discusses impairment of AMPK in ME patient muscle\nMOTS-c is the more heavy duty AMPK activator and mitochondrial modulator which will replace SPMs eventually\non risk of immune suppression:\nPartially, yes - however, if immune cells (which are energy hungry) have their metabolism improved, there is a counteracting positive effect on immunity\nSPM over omega-3:\nEarly on, for sure - SPMs are intermediates in-between DHA and EPA. in the body they are already ‘committed’ to resolvin/maresin/protectin production\nTaking SPMs helps get around the fact that omega-3s are rapidly damaged by oxidative stress\nEventually, you want to be making these SPMs yourself rather than rely on supplementation\nPeople think you can just take anti-oxidants lmao - no, you need to build a pool on un-oxidised omega 3 can you can produce resolvins on demand\nResolvins/maresins/protectins/lipoxins are metabolic modulators also\nYou can’t mimic what they do fully even with anti-oxidants and SPMs, you are supposed to produce them on demand to resolve inflammation and tailor metabolism for that process when required\nAs you are chronically inflamed this matters much less\nYou just need to reduce inflammation full stop. Dumping in SPMs in net good - same if an athlete has just ran a marathon, dump in some SPMs and recover faster, all good\nOtherwise - you would rather produce them on demand so that whenever you exert specific muscles/increase metabolism in tissues or organs, you can have a co-ordinated pro-resolving response when and where required\nDifferent organs and tissues produce different resolvins/maresins/lipoxins/protectins etc\nSorry, didn’t differentiated between SPMs and resolvins/maresins/protectins/lipoxins etc - the SPMs are ‘committed’ to pro-resolving mediator production rather than being the mediators themselves\nsulforaphane:\nNrf2 controls detoxification of lipid peroxidation byproducts\nSulforaphane inducing Nrf2 usually increases glutathione production and aldehyde dehydrogenase function - acrolein, 4-HNE and malondialdehyde are detoxified by GSH, the latter two by ALDHs\nNow - sulforaphane doesn’t always work\nSome mycotoxins are particularly awkward as they hyperactivate Nrf2, which causes it’s own set of problems\nVNS = maybe dangerous:\nI have seen people get way worse on it. Firstly, when you stimulate the vagus nerve you stimulate the vagal anti-inflammatory reflex. Vagus nerve → splenic nerve → spleen, which then interacts with immune cells to reduce and/or change their function, dependent on target immune cell. You can go overboard with this. If you use VNS too much, you are reducing immune function and can allow certain pathogens the space to thrive. This is especially dangerous in people with SIBO or systemic fungal infections, like mucocutaneous candidiasis. Also - sometimes people use the VNS, and over time it stops working. Other efforts to stimulate vagus nerve function can then also fail\namoxicillin effective?\nThe idea at first was to test why amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was causing remissions in people with ME. Some people with long COVID also reported it - so they had a small pilot study where 4 people did it, 3 had a very good response after doing a preparation protocol for gut/inflammation/oxidative stress then amoxiclav\nBeta-lactams can induce expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1/EAAT2 on glia, which allows for them to mop up glutamate more effectively - this mechanism is thought to be negatively impacted in people with LC/ME, potentiating glutamate excitotoxicity\nwww.nature.com/articles/nature03180\nSo the fact that many people responded this way is very interesting. Of course, some people do get way worse after taking these antibiotics, but the RB protocol does have probiotics pre- and post-amoxiclav to counteract this\nHowever - not everyone can take amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid safely - especially those with atopic disease or liver/kidney damage\nInspiritol:\nEucalyptol and beta-caryophyllene are like  50 euros for 100-200ml each.

From that, I could infer she was in heart failure\nShe went to doctor, ECG was abnormal, found myocardial ischemia. She spoke to Dr Goodenowe (the guy who runs Prodrome) and tapered up from tiny doses to avoid the repletion side effects; she is still alive today thankfully\nI found other reactions to the plasmalogens (rare) which are very likely diagnostic of organ failure or neurodegenerative disease.\nSo, the plasmalogens can help diagnose organ failure, but they also help combat it - as the failing organ/damaged areas of brain have severe redox stress, plasmalogens get depleted severely. This means patients who have a very severe or life-threatening illness are vulnerable to the plasmalogen repletion side effects, but can benefit massively from them also\nThey won’t have repletion side effects unless they have critical damage to an organ or tissue itself\nEven people who are severely ill with active inflammatory processes due to vaccines, EBV reactivation, etc - if they don’t have critical organ or tissue damage which would cause severe plasmalogen depletion, then they do not react poorly\nThey have ProdromeGlia and ProdromeNeuro, Glia is likely the best one\nPeople usually respond better to the glia; a lot of people just don’t like taking the Prodrome neuro due to side effects. Not been able to figure out why people get those from Neuro but not Glia\nOther plasmalogen supplements (made from shellfish usually) contain 100x less\npatent: patents.google.com/patent/US9334235B2/en\nsinus rinses:\n“Available from your local chemist, Neilmed make sinus washing products – such as “Sinugator” and “Sinus Rinse”, which can be highly effective at pre-rinsing these difficult-to-reach mucosal tissues, 20 minutes prior to application of any antiseptic products.\n2g boric acid and 5–10mg of liquid iodine can also be added to the Neilmed solution, for additional potency, however this may not be appropriate for daily use. A temporary smell of iodine and some burning / stinging would also be expected where infected tissues exist.\nNote: Due to the die-off effect when killing fungi, using this antiseptic recipe while not using the other supplements from Stage 1 may be unnecessarily unpleasant and exacerbate symptoms.”\nMannan binding lectin (MBL) deficiency:\nMannan binding lectin is something that helps your system recognize pathogens like Borrelia, Aspergillus, Candida, S-CoV-2\nMBL deficiency is the most common form of immunodeficiency\npolyphenols:\nPolyphenols are antioxidants, modulate inflammatory pathways - they definitely have biological activity. There is a lot of folk knowledge which does have some actual rooting in reality - there are some people who have recovered using high dose rutin, or using Chinese traditional medicine, although these stories are few and far between\nI think certain interventions have uses in certain circumstances. For example, there is someone with a cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome in our cohort - the likely best thing to target that (NLRP3 mutation) with minimal side effects is oridonin, which is in a TCM herb; the alternatives would likely be powerful immunosuppresants like anakinra or canakinumab\nRutin has anti SARS-CoV-2 activity and is a reasonably powerful anti-inflammatory.\nHigh dose can mess with calcium channels, going to experiment with that to see how to modulate\nRutin? Try 500mg, then move towards a gram to 2 grams a day - you can split throughout the day, especially if you are worried about a large dose sitting in the bowel and making SIBO worse\nNano-carrier formulation of rutin would be an excellent one, assume your guys could do easily\nNano-carrier polyphenols dealing with the absorption issue also prevents the potential negative effects on microbiome, which is excellent\nI always add a bit of black pepper to anything with polyphenols in, to increase absorption - like many companies do with piperine and curcumin\nI used to make a drink from ginger/sumac/elderflower/black pepper. Was surprisingly effective for settling stomach\nHibiscus is excellent (I use it to sleep when I have it) and should be available .Can’t have too much though, powerful diuretic\nYou could add in natural substances with anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity - rutin, gallic acids (sumac suggested here because of this), piperine can bind to viral proteins;\nwww.downtoearth.org.in/science-technology/black-pepper-may-hold-the-key-for-corona-fighting-drug-study-73822\nNarcissoside (isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside) is a favourite of mine, as I love elderflower - when I was well pre-2020/when I got better in 2022, I could just go find some elder trees/pick it and dry them. Good elderflower is about 10% narcissoside and rutin\nrutin and AMPK increase:\nwww.iherb.com/pr/naturesplus-biorutin-1000-mg-90-tablets/7607\nI will be starting this biorutin (rutin and citrus flavonoids, Tess sent me some!) soon - will keep an eye out for calcium channel related side effects, I am likely sensitive to them\nRutin can increase calcium influx into cells\nCalcium activates cellular processes, dependent on the cell type\nSo it can cause GI discomfort, palpitations, headache, dizziness\nRutin is increasing glucose uptake by muscle cells\nIf you end up increasing metabolism when you can’t handle it, same process may occur as with the NADH - you feed mitochondrial complex 1 and NADPH oxidases, you make ROS, that tanks you\nRutin solves the AMPK problem in muscle cells;\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938427/\nIn ME (and likely many with moderate/severe LC without PEM also, my opinion however/not proven yet) muscle cells have reduced AMPK activity\nThis results in reduced influx of glucose into muscle\nSo rutin increases glucose uptake and mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle. Problem is that if you turn the taps back on again, you need the pro-resolving response to exertion to happen. If rutin doesn’t solve that also, you have a problem\nWith metformin (AMPK activator), one can get hypoglycemia and/or increased lactate production. If mitochondrial biogenesis doesn’t quite do the job, lactate is produced as TCA cycle/oxidative phosphorylation are not functioning properly; cells are taking up extra nutrients to burn however. This creates issues\nSo there are a variety of responses to direct or indirect AMPK activators which infer specific metabolic defects\nAs increasing cell fuel supply means more mitochondrial stress. You have to have the tools to resolve the inflammatory response after extra mitochondrial activity results\nmonoclonal antibodies/mAbs:\nIdeally, you get the big guns. mAbs is more risky, as more costly and may not work unless you definitely know what variant you were originally infected with/whether that mutated enough if there is an active and productive reservoir\nensitrelvir:\nEnsitrelvir would be excellent if you can get it. You can try a few different things -\nsafety:\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354224000603\nI know this is a mouse study - but they give essentially a huge dose of ensitrelvir to these mice, up to 128mg/kg - this doesn’t directly equate to human exposure because of various different factors, but 128mg/kg for a 60kg human is 7.68 grams\ntaken with metformin:\nacademic.oup.com/ofid/article/9/Supplement_2/ofac492.975/6902877\nDual mathematical modelling/human study on ensitrelvir and metformin\nThey predict a very large dose of ensitrelvir (1000mg) could increase metformin exposure (slightly, by 12%) when they consider factors with mathematical modelling\nhowever, there is barely any difference seen in a human cohort taking both drugs. The dosage of ensitrelvir used is not disclosed, need to find a full paper now - it is probably the 375mg/125mg dosage regimen\nI am reasonably satisfied they don’t interact enough regarding each others metabolism\nmetformin:\nHowever - the anti-inflammatory effect of metformin is not to be coughed at, yeah\nMetformin can cause headaches/nausea/low blood sugar/very rarely lactic acidosis, so I particularly recommend seeing how people respond to metformin before using it when ill. I think famotidine/ensitrelvir is superior to famotidine/metformin or ensitrelvir/metformin when regarding tolerability\nfamotidine:\nHigh dose famotidine (80mg, 3x a day) is a reasonably potent COVID anti-viral, although this dose can cause quite significant fatigue in some\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X24012993\nFamotidine induces ROS generation in cells and primes anti-viral immunity via interferon alpha\nSo, it is particularly useful taken early on to prime bystander cells. people who usually die of COVID have an insufficient immune response at first; virus multiplies and spreads, immune system kicks in extremely hard and gets exhausted. huge problems ensue if COVID and other pathogens are still unchecked after immune exhaustion\nHaving something acidic to drink can be useful if reduced stomach acid is a problem\ncan cause fatigue:\nRegarding famotidine - it can cause fatigue in a small number of people. ensitrelvir will likely amplify this effect if so\nThe dose of famotidine could be reduced to 60mg 3x a day once ensitrelvir is initiated? Although I would probably stick with 80mg 3x a day unless I had symptoms from famotidine\nvs ensitrelvir/antivirals:\nSo - famotidine is better at priming response, ensitrelvir is better at reducing the viral load in cells or compartments that are already infected\nRather, I was considering the fact that ensitrelvir is very difficult to source\nFamotidine could be used as a stopgap to treat during the limbo phase of ‘will or won’t I test positive’ - when one tests positive, take the ensitrelvir immediately. It fits thematically, as famotidine prevents viral spread effectively - it also saves one from pre-emptively taking doses of ensitrelvir, this could be expensive if there are multiple infections a year\nwith ensitrelvir:\nEnsitrelvir and famotidine are both p-glycoprotein transporter substrates, like ivermectin is\nFamotidine would introduce (somewhat weak) p-glycoprotein transporter inhibition, which would increase ensitrelvir concentration slightly in CNS, kidneys, liver, intestines\nEnsitrelvir competing with famotidine would have a similar very weak effect - it would increase famotidine concentrations slightly\nRegarding ensitrelvir itself - this is likely a bonus. It is indicated for use in children 12 and up - if children and small adults tolerate 375mg loading dose and 125mg maintenance dose days 2-5, adults can tolerate slightly increased exposure for sure\nensitrelvir+metformin+famotidine:\nTaking all three could be justified. A reduced metformin dose (or, even, replacement with bitter melon) makes sense as famotidine/ensitrelvir should effectively target viral spread and infected cells, respectively - there shouldn’t be as much inflammation\nMetformin theoretically reduces famotidine’s ability to induce intracellular anti-viral immunity, in some situations - AMPK activation usually reduces cellular ROS production\nthymosin alpha 1/TA1:\nI am thinking that persons in your family who are already ill or aged may herx on TA1. Doing that whilst infected with COVID is not optimal\nHowever - it seems remarkably efficacious and well tolerated pneumonia.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41479-023-00116-6\nI am assuming maximum benefit would be derived from doing a course beforehand and then doing a course during infection\nJared is describing (partially) TA1s ability to reduce immune exhaustion rapidly\nIn people with ME/CFS, using TA1 can induce herx reactions - immune stimulation and reducing exhaustion results in a large increase in immune function. I am assuming some aged (70+) persons or anyone with combined considerable pathogenic issues and immune exhaustion otherwise would also herx in a similar fashion\nEven if TA1 has anti-inflammatory properties, the released bacterial LPS/other bacterial and fungal toxins can activate your immune system and overpower it\nTA1 probably doesn’t do this in 95%+ of people in general - I need to focus on fringe cases so people know what to expect if things don’t go as planned\nmonolaurin:\nResponding to monolaurin hints at a bacterial or fungal component here\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4738477/\nMonolaurin could suppress Borrelia\nMonolaurin does reduce T cell function, whilst being useful as a direct anti-pathogen (www.nature.com/articles/srep30225) maybe the diminishing returns after a few weeks were as a result of this?\nCan be both helpful and deleterious - reduces short term symptoms, may allow pathogens not sensitive to monolaurin to thrive in the mid to long term\nmold genes debunked?\nThere has been some pushback on that\nwww.mygenefood.com/blog/mold-genes/\nThe likelihood is that hundreds if not thousands of genes impact how likely one is to get mold related illness - people treating those with mold related illness cannot correlate genetic data with disease severity/likelihood to recover\nHBOT:\nHBOT is usually very good - a small number of people do respond very poorly, I believe those with CSF leaks?\nCerebrospinal fluid can leak when intracranial pressure is high for a long period of time\nmagnesium toxicity theories:\nWas thinking about how much magnesium would have to be sent into cells to crash you, would have to be a decent amount - was theorizing liver overload but couldn’t find anything concrete enough\nbad reaction to LOLA or ammonia/glutamate/glutamine toxicity:\n[herx like reaction?] Potentially so - even then, if you were very severe the side effects would have overstimulated you, which is not good enough. Have to figure out whether a slower taper is good enough, or if something like rutin needs to be added in combination\nVEGF contributes to NO production - the urea cycle provides arginine for eNOS\nSo there could be a world where you are reacting to the increased NO production\nIncreased NO should improve cerebral perfusion before ROS production brings on side effects\nSo if there was a lag phase of feeling good then feeling awful, we could try bring this into the picture\n[delayed effects]\nThis is more evidence for eNOS uncoupling. perhaps LOLA should stimulate glymphatic drainage somewhat\nAnd the extent of the eNOS uncoupling or other lymphatic dysfunction dictates whether this happens or not\neNOS is everywhere - but it is a lens we can use to understand endothelial/lymphatic dysfunction in a limited sense\nWe will see what happens as you increase - I think the side effects infer that there is in fact excess ammonia in the brain, and that the problem is getting rid of the glutamine produced from glutamate and ammonia\nThis is not a normal reaction, but we should be able to find out what TCA cycle problems cause this\nProduction of glutamate from aspartate and oxaloacetate is a reversible reaction\n\nL-Aspartate + α-ketoglutarate → oxaloacetate + L-glutamate, rather\n\nWhy is it running in that single direction?\nSo, we have an enzyme of interest - aspartate transaminase\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15830392/\nPeroxynitrite (made from nitric oxide and superoxide, as we have discussed before) can inactivate the glutamine synthetase enzyme which produces glutamine from glutamate and ammonia\nIf LOLA then goes ahead and increases glutamine synthetase, this excess of glutamate and ammonia is converted to glutamine\nsimilar to PEM?\nPerhaps the glutamate excess is causing you to internalise your NMDA receptors - Kat believes this is what causes PEM. If you are getting PEM-like crashes, it could be that NMDA is being internalised, which would explain why you just shut down\n\nmore burns, no PEM\n\nOk. this infers glutamate is being converted to glutamine at a more rapid rate\nI feel you aren’t making enough glutamate to trigger PEM threshold before it gets converted to glutamine, until you are severely dysregulated\nraised ICP?\nIf it is raised ICP, we need to fix glymphatic drainage\nhigh dose thiamine or diamox (acetazolamide) can be a short to mid term solution\nI am thinking about aspartate and eNOS. Aspartate can be neurotoxic if it builds up, arginine could be feeding eNOS\nHow have you responded to melatonin before?\nAmmonia can be processed into carbamoyl phosphate. ornithine is added to make citrulline, this is the start of the urea cycle - this is ‘good’ processing of ammonia\nHowever, ammonia + glutamate can form glutamine. Glutamate can be formed from aspartate + oxaloacetate; this glutamine formed from glutamate + ammonia can then cause brain swelling if it is not cleared\nGlutamine causes its own set of problems - it isn’t directly toxic, but it causes osmotic stress\nIf the problem is raised ICP, diamox should improve it - however, this is not guaranteed as you need a functional lymphatic system\n[ICP but no pressure feeling?]\nYou aren’t going to feel you have raised ICP unless it is extremely severe - the only nociceptors inside your skull are in the meninges covering the brain, not the brain itself. The burns you are getting are likely as a result of them being inflamed\nUsually, the most common symptoms people with raised ICP experience are headaches, vision changes, nausea, dizziness, muscle weakness, seizures, ataxia, numbness (especially in extremities), agitation/rage, shallow rapid breathing\nThe theory is that spike can get into meninges and make them [the meninges] hyperresponsive to additional inflammatory pressures\nAnd/or spike can persist in the blood marrow in the skull\ntinnitus:\n“Within the tinnitus group, Glu levels (in primary auditory cortex) positively correlated with tinnitus loudness measures…”\nwww.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07835-8\nSo they found lower glutamate and higher glutamine in primary auditory cortex in tinnitus sufferers. Glutamine level also correlates with symptom severity\nneuronal NOS uncoupling:\nNeuronal NOS can also be uncoupled (www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860319300588), so thinking about this also\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4746709/\nNitric oxide modulates glial uptake of glutamate, this concerns nNOS moreso than eNOS\nSo nitric oxide deficiency could result in glutamate excitotoxicity and blood flow dysregulation in tandem\n\nand glutamine → osmotic stress → ICP?\n\nThis happens if suddenly the glia are able to take up the glutamate and convert it to glutamine\nThe glutamine synthetase enzyme is in glia\nSo if you are struggling to take up the glutamate, this causes classical glutamate excitotoxicity\nIf one allow the glia to take up glutamate and convert to glutamine slowly, there is not much of a huge response\nBut, if the glia take up a load of glutamate and convert all of that to glutamine before being able to dispose of some of it (perhaps due to malfunctioning lymphatic system?) then you have a problem\nGlutamine makes sense for the severe tinnitus, for sure\nIt makes some sense for the burns\ngenome analysis method:\nI go through each gene individually to verify likelihood of pathogenicity, then try and create a model of how the systems interact. I then look for symptoms which fit the genetic model, then find ones that do not; for example, a person with ACE hyperfunction should have trouble with losing weight, have high blood pressure, vascular disease. Someone with slow COMT should generally not respond well to modafinil - however, I have found 2 people with slow COMT who respond rather excellently, and I have found people with ACE hyperfunction who do not have issues with weight\nTo make a further example - a person with slow COMT responded well to dopamine. I know, therefore, they have pathogens or toxins which are reducing tyrosine hydroxylase (which makes L-DOPA from tyrosine) and/or a problem with their dopaminergic neurons themselves\nSo I go through all genes related to pathogens, inflammation and dopaminergic neurons. They have a mannose binding lectin deficiency and carboxypeptidase E deficiency, which means they have hypofunction of lectin complement pathway, but increased complement activity otherwise (as carboxypeptidase E cleaves the complement anaphylatoxins). Complement can play a role in dopaminergic neurodegeneration\nOAT suggests aspergillus, likely secondary to the mannose binding lectin deficiency. Aspergillus byproducts can inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase\nThey have improved after using itraconazole, are taking anti-oxidants and other supplements (Bacopa, iirc?) to protect dopaminergic neurons; the course of itraconazole was not great, however they are doing rather well now. Will follow up with them again shortly\npet theories:\nDon probably thinks he is being helpful - yeah, there are very few people out there who know what they are talking about, unfortunately\nPeople make gains in one area, attribute it to something specific like viral persistence then go mad trying to get research to focus on that one thing. “If only the anti-viral was better, if only we had better probiotics, if only we had better ways to limit toxic exposure”\nOf course all these things are needed - however, we need to understand how all of these systems interact rather than putting our eggs in one basket. An example - people were using products like Tollovid (purified gromwell root extract, marketed as 3CLpro inhibitor/anti-viral) which also had anti-inflammatory activity. My good friend’s wife took Tollovid without having COVID before; it helped with their PMDD and metabolic syndrome. So, many people who thought they had persistent virus because of using Tollovid likely did not. Inflammatory processes may increase sensitivity to myco- or enviromental toxins, or may promote viral persistence; combination therapies derived from drugs and supplements we already know are safe and effective are likely to be more effective than any single new drug which only has one major mechanism of action\nHopefully, we can convince people to not go into their cliques with their pet theories\ntollovid:\nI approached him regarding Tollovid and it’s potential off target anti-inflammatory effects, he knows they exist but hasn’t really pursued researching them further\nThey went to the trouble of purifying the extract of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, so they made a good product imo\npycnogenol:\nPycnogenol is not bad at all, some people really respond well\nArterosil and pycnogenol are the best supplements which are least likely to have negative side effects or long term risk, imo\nPycnogenol may take 4 weeks at 100 or 150mg a day to show a positive effect\nPycnogenol could cause side effects on the first day(s) of use\nWould likely result from increased NO production/reduced NO scavenging\nSulodexide often takes about a month as well, tbh\nThey should act synergistically\ntissue death:\nSo tissues die if they don’t get oxygen for more than a few minutes - brain is most energy hungry and therefore most sensitive. Some don’t get killed for many hours or days, skin and bone cells especially\nThere is limited cell death in LC/ME - we know there is muscle necrosis, we know that small blood vessels can have problems due to their own blood supply (vasa vasorum) being interrupted by microclots; we know there is neurological damage\nhowever PEM is a compensatory mechanism which prevents one from over-exerting and killing off your cells, especially in the brain. Once you push far enough past your anaerobic limit, you produce cytokines/growth associated factors like GDF15/other inflammatory factors/ROS; your brain responds by becoming more inflamed itself/increasing sympathetic drive. Excitotoxicity → PEM → forced recovery\nL reuteri:\nL reuteri is excellent at destroying biofilm/outcompeting pathogens - will have to chat with you about this more\nnacrolepsy like mechanism?\nIn narcoleptics, focusing hard on anything can induce sleep - a friend of mine reports this often\nthe ventral tegmental area/nucleus accumbens (VTA/NAc) should suppress sleep and promote wakefulness\nIn central pain syndromes like ‘fibromyalgia’, the nucleus accumbens, VTA and periaqueductal grey (PAG) dopaminergic control of nociception is busted, rather than the sleep architecture like in narcolepsy\njournals.lww.com/pain/abstract/2004/07000/opiate_anti_nociception_is_attenuated_following.26.aspx\nWithout dopaminergic control of PAG, opiates fail to actually deliver in regard to anti-nociception\nI know - but the trigger, attempting to focus hard, is the same\nOAT rationale:\nWe are using it for evidence of bacterial/fungal infections, SIBO, metabolic syndromes/diabetes (using Krebs/ketone markers), oxidative stress, neurotransmitter status (more useful in severe patients), oxalate (which can be pro-inflammatory in excess), oxidative stress, vitamin status to compare with red blood cell data; minerals like phosphate are important, especially in malnourished people\ntoxic exposure/methylation defects raise 2-hydroxybutyrate, orotic acid would indicate if there is an ammonia problem (which could be managed with L-ornithine/L-aspartate)\nIt is a good to guide where to look next/what the general issues are. Of course, it is just a snapshot in time, and we are still learning - Joshua Leisk is excellent at reading these, he had used them since pre-pandemic\nOAT:\ncan see evidence of fungal infection, likely candida - increased 3-oxoglutarate (3) and arabinose (7).\nBacterial markers largely unremarkable\nKrebs cycle looks like candida is shifting it. Page 2 explains what I am talking about, markers on page 3\nSuccinate/fumarate/malate (24/25/26) are all increased in relation to 2-oxoglutarate/aconitate/citrate (27/28/29). There is no excess in oxalate, however it looks like there is ‘theft’ of isocitrate by Candida\nIncreased 3-hydroxyglutarate (31) infers there is mitochondrial dysfunction. Can be seen in people with lead or mercury exposure, will think about alternative explanations\nSometimes people have a particular problem with quinolinic acid - this is a neurotoxic tryptophan metabolite\nDoesn’t seem you have this issue at first glance\nIt doesn’t look like aspergillus much at all - GI and sinus candida seems most likely\nOAT - high phosphorus:\nHigh phosphorus could mean that you are resistant to parathyroid hormone (causes low calcium, high phosphorus) or mean you are breaking down bone faster than one would like\nFirst is unlikely, some people with LC/ME do break down bone faster though - I would like to see them ruled out if we can find evidence for their existence\nDo you have brittle nails?\nOr have the white crescents (lunulae) at the base of your nails got smaller or disappeared on any of your nails?\nOAT - b vitamins:\nB6 supplementation seems like a good idea, likely as P5P\nHigh B5 infers that production of Coenzyme A from pantothenate may be impaired. Hints at carnitine yet again\nOAT - NAC/C imbalance → glutathione issue?\nAscorbate (54) is fine but NAC (56) is not - likely as a result of nano-carrier vit C use?\nAscorbate/vitamin C. Normally one would see ascorbate and NAC are low together\nSo, perhaps there is a problem with glutathione production - you are making cysteine from homocysteine at an accelerated rate (59)\nVitamin C should help reconstitute active glutathione\nCandida itself can deplete L-cysteine, acetaldehyde conjugates with it - this product is not toxic, which is excellent, however it does mean L-cysteine is being stolen\n(Cysteine is required for glutathione production)\n[would glutathione supplemenation help?] Most likely, yes. some people do not react well supplements containing sulfur, however, which is part of the reason I wanted to check your biomesight - hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria will use glutathione as a substrate\nGlutathione could cause side effects - they are rarely severe, however I would rather know for sure if you have methanobrevibacter overgrowth\nOAT - H2S/sulfur toxicity &amp; bile connection &amp; autophagy:\nStill thinking about onion and nitric oxide/bile acids. Will have to come back to it later\nCysteine is a source of sulfur as well unfortunately - but in small amounts, it should not cause a problem at all\nTaurine/TUDCA can also increase H2S production. We see poor responses to these occasionally\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352345X16301242\nSo - CYP7A1 controls bile acid production in the liver. This can be stimulated by H2S\nThis sets off a program where autophagy should be activated and bile acids should be produced\nWithout the autophagic flux, there is no positive response\nH2S should increase bile acid production\nFor some reason, you had the opposite response - this is likely as the capacity for your cells to eat up old proteins/organelles (autophagy) is impaired\nH2S should trigger autophagy - so if it isn’t, there is either a problem with autophagy itself or the process by which H2S controls autophagy\nH2S can modulate proteins itself - this is called “sulfhydration”. If there is an excess of H2S, there is an excess of sulfhydrated proteins (like mTOR); cellular functions are warped by this excess\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0003986186903140\nThe oxidative stress caused by cellular dysfunction leads to the scavenging of these sulfhydryl groups\nSo, H2S becomes unable to modulate cellular functions such as autophagy when there is runaway oxidative stress\nLow amounts of H2S function excellently, have a protective effect - PI3K/Akt/mTOR is reduced\nLarge amounts of H2S have the opposite effect, this activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR\nThis may be a problem if you do have H2S producing species in gut\nI suggested eucalyptol as a soft way to test this out\nH2S associated inflammation is reduced by eucalyptol\nA friend puts a couple of drops in a N95 mask and puts that on\nThey notice more energy and less brain fog, yeah\nTo explain further - mTOR inhibits autophagy (controlled by AMPK)\nAutophagy is critical for recycling proteins and organelles\nMitophagy is similarly controlled by AMPK\nSo if there is impaired autophagy/mitophagy, you cannot replace damaged mitochondria fast enough\nExcessive H2S can also inhibit mitochondrial complex IV, which adds to the issues\nFor the vast majority of people, in the vast majority of relevant cell types\n[so this lack of replacement is what’s causing continuous severity increase in ME?]\nYeah - Rob Wust et al. recent paper discusses this\nThey see a reduction in not just mitochondrial function but the number of mitochondria themselves\nOAT - ketosis/beta-oxidation issues:\n43/44 - you are definitely in ketosis\nMild ketosis. Have seen 10x these values\nBut, the high suberic and low sebacic acids means there is a problem with this beta oxidation process\nSo, we break down fatty acids using a process called beta-oxidation\nThis requires mitochondrial enzymes\nSo, if beta-oxidation fails due to mitochondrial dysfunction, there is a backup process known as omega oxidation\nDiscussed your results briefly in the meeting - carnitine transport deficiency could explain some of the beta-oxidation findings. Previous positive response to MCT oil also infers this problem, as the major thing we need to rule out here (MCAD deficiency) would result in a rather poor response to MCT oil\nSo, large doses of carnitine (and not ALCAR) might be an excellent shout here\nSo, carnitine is required for mitochondrial beta oxidation\nWhen we have deficiency in carnitine or carnitine transport is messed up, beta-oxidation is impaired\nFats are then sent to the endoplasmic reticulum for omega-oxidation\nOmega oxidation can itself be impaired by endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, reduced NADPH production\nSuberic acid levels are high when beta-oxidation fails. Sebacic acid should be produced via omega oxidation - levels here are rather low\nKat has the same findings in regard to suberic and sebacic acids - but she can’t get into ketosis at all\nOAT - dopamine:\nDopamine synthesis issues are likely best explained by Candida production of acetaldehyde\n[L-cysteine] Yeah, taking 100mg multiple times a day is best way to deal with acetaldehyde production throughout the day\nUnfortunately, there is a dopamine metabolite not mentioned in the OAT - I can infer that there is a problem here though.\n3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde is a somewhat toxic dopamine metabolite - this requires metabolism by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). This enzyme is unfortunately inhibited by acetaldehyde itself\nUnfortunately, again, aldehyde dehydrogenase is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress - so oxidative stress from any other source plus acetaldehyde equals a sufficient one-two hit which disables and overloads the enzyme\non not eating protein:\nThis will be a problem, yes - 40/50g a day protein on average is the absolute minimum you should aim for. Less than this is not feasible in the long run\ncandida:\n\nhow to fix?\n\nYou have somewhat started? The fulvic acid and the mastic gum are both useful\nDihydromyricetin should help with die off when you do start fulvic acid again - will figure out the best way forwards otherwise\nCandida can be a lot more difficult to treat than just a single course of anti-fungals - you are welcome to try, but it is usually the case that people with chronic candida infection need months to clear it\nCandida will also cause problems with dopamine - acetaldehyde at first increases dopaminergic system function. Acetaldehyde levels rise, inhibiting the dopamine biosynthesis enzyme(s)\nSo eliminating candida (or, at least, keeping it under control) is likely critical to restoring dopamine and gut function. I think start KPV asap\nkpv:\nI have been looking for stories of KPV use in people with candida - it seems to work well during the course, some people lose weight, however candida and associated symptoms return afterwards if other factors (biofilm/microbiome dysbiosis, mold exposure,  etc) are not dealt with\nI am thinking that KPV should give you a window to start hitting gut harder with probiotics/fulvic acid\nundecylenic acid (aka SF722) is great to add for candida also\nmeldonium/mildronate:\nI worked out what I want you to try last night, if you can get hold of it (should be relatively easy)\nIf carnitine and ALCAR don’t work, a problem you may likely have is that fatty acid oxidation is inducing insulin resistance\nThere is a drug used as a performance enhancing drug by athletes called mildronate (Meldonium) which enhances oxygen utilisation. Unlike other PEDs like cardarine/roxadustat, there is no risk of severe side effects like cancer/strokes and heart attacks respectively - mildronate is used to treat heart failure/angina etc\nI found a paper (www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987719309831)\nwhich discusses Meldonium usage in ME patients; 7/16 improved, some almost completely recovered; frontal lobe and brainstem hypoperfusion shown on a NeuroSPECT scan reversed in one of these patients\nIt would mean that fatty acid oxidation is causing insulin resistance via fatty acid oxidation by-products. We know you are partially in ketosis despite carbohydrate intake being reasonable\nEven if you almost totally recover after taking it, there is still some fatty acid oxidation defect or other problem which needs rooting out\nMeldonium should improve microbiome - we need to see if it makes you agitated, and how your digestion/GI function holds up\nreduces TMAO:\nI am still learning more about meldonium each day. Meldonium reduces TMAO production quite drastically, apparently - so it could be part of a strategy to improve microbiome/cardiovascular function incrementally. The reality is that we need to work out a perfect diet for you, and we need to see what happens regarding the sugar-loving pathogens\npulsing:\nI don’t think you do meldonium for long periods of time, I think short courses again to see impact is most useful\nMeldonium can increase liver adiposity (in rats, mice) when used at very high dose for long periods of time. You won’t reach anywhere near the dose given in these experiments, however we must be cognizant of every possibility - L-carnitine generally has the opposite effect\nberberine:\nwww.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-01027-6\nCholine can be metabolised into TMAO (trimethylamine oxide) in the gut. This increases risk of atherosclerosis\nBerberine reduces the amount of TMAO your gut microbiome can produce\nbiomesight:\nHydrogen sulfide does look like it is a problem, high Bilophila\nLacto and Bifido through floor as expected\n[leaky gut → endotoxemia] It could play a huge role - leaky gut means increased systemic inflammation, which pressures brain (via cytokines, GDF15, mast cell activation, urea cycle dysfunction). Brain inflammation makes gut problems worse as vagal control is impaired - the gut barrier is reliably damaged after TBIs with no abdominal trauma or other confounder\nThis is essentially a feedback loop between systems of systems. Gut is the easiest to access and therefore the easiest to treat\nWe need to improve gut slowly over a period of time. There is no quick fix for that unfortunately\nThis is why I have tried to focus on getting quick improvements elsewhere. Dealing with dysbiosis is often a war of attrition\nBS - akkermansia:\nFirst strange thing for me is Akkermansia - most people with ME/LC have decreased Akkermansia. there are a small number who have increased Akkermansia; some of these report burning pain in head or abdomen\nIf you look online regarding Akkermansia, many people will try and lead you to believe that very high levels are not pathogenic. They are frickin stupid lmao\nAnyways - Akkermansia muciniphila degrades mucins, like other sialidase expressing bacteria\nToo little Akkermansia is detrimental - it helps promote gut health by degrading mucin. It makes a protein known as P9 which is thought to act as a GLP-1 releaser\nSo Akkermansia has a large positive effect on metabolism - it protects against insulin resistance\nHowever when Akkermansia gets out of hand, it can degrade the mucus barrier which is required for gut health. This causes increased gut permeability; you have a large amount of LPS producing bacteria in your gut also. This causes metabolic endotoxemia\nModafinil works in my friend with ADHD and high Akkermansia/post-vac symptoms. hmm\nI am working on an Akkermansia/glutamate hypothesis\nakkermansia:\nAkkermansia does like polyphenols. Need to find a reliable way of reducing it - this is one of the final problems I am looking to solve before settling on a protocol. THC is supposedly excellent for reducing Akkermansia, but not a viable option here; CBD can raise Akkermansia levels, which may explain your previous poor response (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470626/)\nmodafinil:\nWe want to make sure that you don’t just feel great on modafinil then crash yourself - so mitochondrial support first makes sense. I do want you to try this sooner rather than later however\ncysteine:\nWell - you didn’t respond to the NAC (you did try it briefly), but you did to the cysteine\nIf the tinnitus reverses after increasing cysteine, then either NC cysteine is a better glutathione precursor, and/or cysteine was deficient and you are solving some of the H2S/transsulfuration issues\nCystine is two cysteine molecules bonded together by their sulfur moieties\nTODO insert pic\nYou may notice the CBS/CTH enzymes are involved in producing cysteine are also involved in producing H2S\nI was assuming you would respond well in relation to your glutamine/tinnitus/burns symptoms.\nCysteine + glutamate + glycine = glutathione - so you will scavenge glutamate to produce glutathione, as long as the cysteine gets absorbed\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6052103/\nCysteine is a preferred energy source for Bilophila, which would produce H2S from it\nNAC still has that available thiol (-SH) group. The assumption is that people who have GI reactions to NAC have an overgrowth of H2S producers, still need more sample size\nYou likely would have had low cysteine before - adding a large amount stimulates H2S production (causing GI symptoms?) - we already know you produce a lot of H2S\nThis process is desulfhydration of cysteine;\ncysteine —CGL⇒ pyruvate, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia - if your urea cycle doesn’t function well, ammonia can cause problems itself\nLarge amounts of cysteine can be pro-oxidant -  it is somewhat unstable and can react with hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl and sulfide free radicals\nCysteine can be converted into cysteinyl luekotrienes by mast cells (causing GI symptoms, wheezing?) - less likely than other explanations but still work thinking about\nCGL here is a human enzyme, cystathionine gamma-lyase\ntranssulfuration:\nThe reality is that this almost confirms transsulfuration issues. Genomics would make it much easier, however we already know cysteine is being depleted by acetaldehyde and ROS, we can work from there\nThere are lots of pieces of information which all point in the same direction\n[what points to it?]\nYour OAT shows there are problems with glutathione. Cysteine is the rate limiting substrate for glutathione production\nIn conditions where there is considerable oxidative stress, cysteine gets depleted via glutathione production, and less so via auto-oxidation\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7728579/\nGlutathione production is controlled by H2S. Mitochondrial damage or inefficiency can lead to transsulfuration pathway problems, which can lead to reduced glutathione production\nGallbladder will have lots of H2S producing species in its microbiome\nH2S increases transsulfuration and glutathione synthesis at low levels via increasing CBS and GCL enzyme activity\nIf there is a large amount of H2S, CTH (aka CGL, mentioned earlier) gets inhibited so you don’t produce more H2S. Unfortunately, you can’t produce much glutathione in those situations either\nSo, the idea is that glutathione production is inhibited by large amounts of H2S. Cysteine itself is sensitive to oxidation, which reduces levels; cysteine can be lost to conjugation with acetaldehyde also, exacerbating the problem\nSo - even if you fix the cysteine problem, unless you can fix the hydrogen sulfide/transsulfuration issue you can’t get the full benefit\nI will find a way to target this specifically. Should be some excellent resources out there\nhydrogen sulfide and associated polysulfides activate TRPA1, inducing calcium influx into cells. This is usually protective if mitochondria function well, however this can cause inflammation when that is not the case - especially in immune cells\nI recommend trying inhaled eucalyptol to inhibit TRPA1, especially now that we know H2S is a very likely a problem here\nCysteine is again the rate limiting substrate for taurine biosynthesis. The taurine you are eating (can’t eat meat, so not much) is getting metabolised by gut bacteria into H2S\nSo you are absorbing less taurine, cysteine is depleted so you produce less also\nTranssulfuration issues are an excellent topic to describe impaired pro-resolving responses\ntranssulfuration and impaired inflammation/ROS resolution:\nSo - we resolve inflammation by\n1/ mopping up oxidative stress - transsulfuration is extremely important here, as glutathione is the master antioxidant\n2/ mopping up debris - glia, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils,  eosinophils help clear away live or killed pathogens, cell debris\n3/ releasing fatty acid derived mediators like resolvins, lipoxins, maresins, protectins - these directly reduce immune cell function/control cell metabolism\nThese are not 3 separate topics, however\nFor 2/ and 3/ to happen, cells/PUFAs need to be protected from inflammation and oxidative stress. Transsulfuration issues therefore cause a raft of other problems downstream\nIncreased effort = increased mitochondrial activity. Increased mitochondrial activity requires resolution of inflammation/ROS which accompanies mitochondrial activity\nIf mitochondria are damaged or otherwise inefficient, they produce more ROS. So you need a greater pro-resolving response to fix the problem\nIn regard to 2/ directly - exertion can cause muscle necrosis in ME patients (recent Wust et al. paper, www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44432-3); exertion is known to increase gut permeability. So, there is an increased need for cells to clear away debris; there is extra inflammation as immune cells respond to the death of muscle cells by producing DAMPs. These prevent resolution of inflammation\nThe resolvins, maresins, protectins often promote mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis via AMPK/PGC-1a - so they can be critical organisers of cellular metabolism under stress conditions\nA fantastic example of the final point is in this paper;\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6864295/\nExercise normally inhibits inflammatory processes - we produce adrenaline, and this signals to immune cells and other cell types (endothelial cells are thought to) for them to produce resolvin D1.\nIn this paper, they focus on macrophages - adrenaline induces these macrophages to produce resolvin D1. RvD1 can then induce mitochondrial biogenesis in a large number of target cell types and reduce inflammation\nantivirals:\nThe vast majority of the currently available anti-virals are actually rather poor quality\nPaxlovid is the most egregious example of this\nEven when nirmatrelvir is boosted with ritonavir, many people still rebound - whether they have acute or chronic COVID infection. People say the same after most anti-viral treatments\nI believe I can explain why;\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9693925/\nThis study finds fluvoxamine, aprepitant, everolimus, sirolimus (rapamycin) are the most potent repurposable anti- SARS-CoV-2 antivirals andnare comparable to what else is on the market right now\nThere is a common running theme with all of these - they are all mTOR inhibitors, directly or indirectly. I believe it could be the case that inflammation spurs on S-CoV-2 replication by reducing lysosomal biogenesis\nSo it is likely the case that anti-virals need to be paired with regimens targeting other pathogens. Even in cases where they work by themselves, if S-CoV-2 hit you hard enough to cause microbiome dysbiosis previously the fact you killed off viable virus is moot\nYou will simply recapitulate after the next exposure\nOr, you would be in danger of a second hit from another pathogen\nThe goal in chronic illness is to increase resilience - not only does S-CoV-2 (or vaccine) cause significant issues itself, one must have predisposing factor(s) (like Candida, Borrelia, genetic immunodeficiencies or inflammatory syndromes, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, etc) which themselves can cause chronic illness if severe enough\nThat being said, any win means you have extra cognition to tackle your other issues\nMany of the cheaper anti-virals available (nitazoxanide, artesunate, aprepitant) etc have multiple mechanisms of action and so gleaning information from their use is more difficult, especially as you have Borrelia. You would likely have to use a couple of different anti-virals which would work during the course before you relapse. If you wanted to prove anti-virals themselves work before pulling the trigger on ensitrelvir, then that is fair enough\nEven then, S-CoV-2 is a purported bacteriophage and could persist in gut microbiome - spike and other proteins can persist without using lumbrokinase, or Candida promotes Borrelia survival in combined biofilms (www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987724002652)\nIf you spend the first few weeks/months of your treatment zoning in on anti-viral treatments, you don’t actually target the root of the problem at all - in the case you spend $1500 on antivirals which work a little during the course but don’t actually improve the candida or Borrelia/leaky gut/metabolic problems secondary to pathogens/neuroinflammation secondary to ammonia etc, you waste time and money\npt. 2:\nI am referring to a few different processes here without naming them - specifically, I am thinking about macrophage phagocytosis\nMacrophage ability to eat up debris is critical when clearing virus - or, in other cases, when clearing up myelin and other products. Otherwise - protein fragments continue causing damage, or there is a reservoir in biofilm which will expand again (one half of what I was calling ‘second exposure’ above)\nSo - you are right, clearing viral reservoirs is great, but you need to do the additional stuff to improve macrophage activity\nEven in cases where anti-inflammatories are supposed to clear virus (Patterson and maraviroc come to mind most), they don’t always work and people can end up reactivating other viruses/bacteria in rare cases\nEnsitrelvir is the gold standard here - clearing viable virus without messing with too much else should deliver optimal results in the vast majority of people\nHowever - reactivated Borrelia/bartonella/EBV/CMV/other HHVs etc can mess with macrophage or glial function themselves. One cannot clear virus by itself and then expect homeostatic mechanisms to fall back into place\nSome people will need help\nSo - regardless of test result or situation, I think grabbing some ensitrelvir is an excellent idea. It is something that I will grab when possible as well\nI would probably just take a course every couple of years (myself)\nThis is something I need to mention to Tamas - it is absolutely about supporting all of the different fundamentals in persons who are moderate/severe\nExactly the same concept with the hemp+ or gigadose anti-oxidant otherwise - if you are mild enough, your regulatory systems snap back into place. If you are moderate/severe, you are in a homeostatic ‘well’ and need two kicks, sometimes in different directions\nI am trying to illustrate systems dynamics without actually explaining them - will have to talk about this more another time\nlarazotide:\nRemember, also - lazarotide increases spike clearance by reducing inflammatory pressure (via metabolic endotoxemia). This inflammatory pressure is nullifying macrophage and glial function, which in turn reduces spike clearance\nLazarotide first seems great because it can help people clear spike (liking via reversing metabolic endotoxemia and subsequent macrophage dysfunction)\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8860335/\nLazarotide is therefore most likely to be useful in those who are failing to clear spike because of macrophage dysfunction (secondary to gut dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction)\nx.com/polybioRF/status/1885414503560388875\ncholestyramine:\nThe cholestyramine will help get rid of ochratoxin A, for sure. There isn’t enough literature on alternariol, however I am decent enough at organic chemistry to be rather sure cholestyramine will work for that as well\nguanfacine:\nThose who are ADHD w/hyperadrenergic POTS seem to benefit most\nbrain damage:\nI don’t think I explained myself well or differentiated classical neurodegenerative processes from what could be reversible\nRegardless, Danielle is producing more evidence of neuron loss; we found large multicellular syncytia in mouse studies. The problem for me is defining what is permanent damage -\nFor example, hippocampal neuron loss can impair memory; most 60-70 year olds have lost a fair amount of their hippocampus. yet, there is enough neurogenesis going on there for most 60-70 year olds for them to have a workable memory and be a million miles away (now, unfortunately, multiple COVID infections will do) from Alzheimer’s pathology.\nIt is hard to argue that a person with this phenotype doesn’t have some mild form of brain damage, but the trains are still firmly on the tracks - until hippocampal and entorhinal cortex degradation is severe enough to cause Alzheimer’s, they would be generally considered ‘healthy’\nNeural stem cells can produce neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes - it makes sense there is a particular focus on hippocampal regeneration, however - to be clear about my personal opinion here -\nI believe that the common myth that neurogenesis is largely limited to hippocampus will be debunked in the next 20-30 years. An example;\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6105389/\nsystemic feedback loop:\nLet’s think of the systemic feedback loop in basic form;\nSpinal cord inflammation/vagal nerve dysfunction → neurogenic inflammation →\ngut barrier dysfunction and microbiome dysbiosis →\nmetabolic endotoxemia, MCAS, nutrient depletion →\nsystemic cellular stress, liver dysfunction →\nsystemic signalling of stress to brain (via cytokines, GDF15, etc) with CNS inflammation →\nglutamate excitotoxicity →\nspinal cord inflammation, vagus nerve dysfunction…\nSubstance P increases sensitivity to PAMPs in multiple cell types - some neurons, all glia, the vast majority of immune cells\nL-carnitine:\nWe want to see what happens with several different things -\nEnergy of course is important. We want to see if switching towards more efficient fat metabolism negatively impacts your sugar metabolism\nEven if carnitine is super useful/mildronate blocks carnitine use by mitochondria, mildronate has a positive effect on microbiome - so we can see how you respond to different fuel sources without you getting any net negatives\nThey give carnitine to people who are hyperthyroid - partially because carnitine stores are used up, but partially because carnitine does in fact reduce thyroid function (when assessing some, but not all parameters)\nI don’t want you using huge dose carnitine for a long time - we want to see how you function on it\nMildronate (despite reducing fat metabolism) can reduce plasma triglycerides and increase thyroid function - this is another reason to have it in the back pocket\nconnection to redox stress:\nWhen redox homeostasis is messed up, so is mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The worse the mitochondrial issues are, the harder it is to use both types of fuel\nCommiting in either direction can be useful\nExample for carnitine -\nwww.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/07315724.1996.10718634:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\nVitamin C depletion results in reduced carnitine and increased histamine levels\nImpaired redox homeostasis can also directly impact carnitine levels\ncastor oil:\nCastor oil can be rather powerful - undecylenic acid is an anti-pathogen component of castor oil which is not irritating\nThe other major anti-pathogenic constitutent in castor is ricinoleic acid. Rather caustic at high concentrations, can irritate GI tract\nivermectin:\nIvermectin is a reasonably useful anti-inflammatory for most people\nI believe that taken early enough in COVID infection, then it does have use. I disagree with the studies released by both sides of the field, Kory doesn’t know what he is doing and the establishment scientists using IVM are doing it too late in treatment course\nThere are very unlucky people who will get poor reactions to IVM\nThe p-glycoprotein transporter is required to pump IVM out of the central nervous system. Rare mutations to this transporter can mean low doses of IVM can cause significant CNS depression/toxicity\nIVM actually enhances GABA signalling (probably the major reason it acts as an anti-inflammatory) - it can therefore knock people into coma-like states in extremely rare cases\nSo - unless I know whether people have viable p-glycoprotein, I never recommend it\nThis doesn’t mean it isn’t effective - for a lot of people, it will be\nluteolin:\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245722009385\nI do like this paper a lot\nLuteolin is particularly impactful but suffers in respect to poor bioavailability. Dr Theoharides (very good mast cell researcher) like luteolin a lot - they were mentioning 6-methoxyluteolin creams which one could rub into temples for increased bioavailability\nIssue is cost. Luteolin is very expensive\nThere are multiple other flavanoids which could be particularly useful - the açai flavanoid velutin is one I have kept my eye on for a long time\nSo - NC luteolin seems like an absolute easy win for Tamas and his team. If they have other moderate/severe patients then especially so\nPEA is good. Luteolin is better\nEspecially when considering mast cell reactions\nUltramicronised PEA/liposomal black pepper (Rephyll, beta-caryophyllene is major active) were the centre points of the RB protocol when Dr T was working with us - so they aren’t bad at all\nLuteolin reduces mast cell reactions and neuroinflammation, tempering glutamate signalling (via GABA-B) on neurons and acting directly on microglia and peripheral immune cells\nLuteolin really is excellent for a lot of people. Only problem is cost\nuncovered metabolic disorder:\nThere are multiple causes for crashes after not eating for a short while - they are usually inborn errors of metabolism involving beta-oxidation, glucose utilisation, Krebs cycle, etc\nThese can be uncovered when people become chronically ill, if they are not severe enough in general to cause problems\nThis isn’t beta-oxidation for you\nYours is good enough\nI went through OAT again with the new information\nComplex I deficiency makes most sense. Complex II is possible\nThis feels like a Leigh’s syndrome mimic\nSuccinate builds up, activates HIF-1a. Mitochondrial function tanks further\nI think there could be a role for propionate here also\nOk - complex I is what I am thinking right now\nNAD depletion really does make sense here as well\nThere is likely a perfect amount of dopamine which induces blood flow, similar to ADHD stimming\nPeroxynitrate is particularly impactful when regarding complex I\nNitrosative species could be tanking it\nComplex I then regulates aldehyde dehydrogenases and the rest of the shit falls from there\nI did mention molybdenum before, need to get on that for you\nI think yesterday was my click moment - I expect NAD+ to improve you. Hopefully you herx much from it\ncistus incanus:\nwww.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1478641924001815\n:O Cistus species are probably doing similar to what sumac does\nGallic acid is the major constituent of sumac\nellagic acid and punicalin are most known as pomegranate derived anti-inflammatories/anti-microbials\nEBV:\nThe first version of each herpesvirus (EBV is aka HHV-4) you get is the one that colonises you, you build a response to others and clear them\nSo, the first EBV (or HHV-6) virus you get determines how troublesome it is over your lifetime\nYou can have multiple different types of herpesviruses, but only one particular variant of each (usually, may be rare cases where this is not the case)\nI am referring to the strain of EBV you got\nYou haven’t had any symptoms highly resembling EBV flare afaik\nFirstly, skin rashes and lymph node swelling\nThere is a usual pattern of nodes go up - fatigue hits (usually more plugged out of socket than poisoned PEM); mild sore throat develops; allergies can flare; muscle pain/fluey symptoms that can resemble herx a little. Left hand sided abdominal pain and right hand sided pain can present\nI am thinking plugged out of socket PEM/RHS pain could be relevant, but nothing jumps out at me particularly which makes me really think EBV flares in yourself\nmethylene blue:\nI think that much is deleterious over a long period of time. Some people see toxicity at less than 100mg doses, especially so if using SSRIs or other serotonergics\nMethylene blue inhibits MAO-A so acts as a reasonably potent antidepressant at high doses. Serotonin however does have pro-inflammatory functions - I would imagine there is a similar pattern of damage in high dose methylene blue users as there is in those using SSRIs\nPut simply - too much serotonin will fry your serotonergic system further\nMethylene blue also has other unusual biphasic response curves. It is potent anti-oxidant and is an electron donor for complex IV at low doses - at high doses, it has the problem almost all other antioxidants have (becomes pro-oxidant). Driving mitochondrial function heavily via complex IV adds more oxidative stress\nDHM/dihydromyricetin:\nDHM targets GABA-A, reduces anxiety/sleep issues/glutamate excitotoxicity\nL-cysteine can help with detoxifying acetaldehyde; L-cysteine binds directly to it to make a non-toxic byproduct\nMost people have no side effects when taking DHM. There may be an acclimisation period; some people find it difficult to sleep at high doses. DHM reduces mTOR function (far less potent than rapamycin); this is likely excellent, but may result in transient side effects also\nmangiferin:\nNo - mangiferin inhibits NADPH oxidases, so can reduce oxidative stress at a major source\nara-290:\nARA-290 increases microvascular function, which supports healing of neural tissue\nTo keep it simple - ARA-290 targets several things;\n1/ eNOS uncoupling\n2/ tissue and nerve damage\n3/ inflammation\n4/ mitochondrial function\nWe know you have all of these problems. ARA-290 can modulate pathways involved with cell repair selectively - only damaged tissues express the receptor for ARA-290 - and it increases mitochondrial STAT3 (good) over nuclear STAT3 (bad)\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8096790/\nARA-290 should improve complex I function and NAD+ production via mtSTAT3\nmemantine:\nSo - memantine acts to reduce glutamate signalling, like ketamine\nUnlike ketamine, which gets stuck in the NMDAR and blocks it very well, memantine can get unstuck much more easily and therefore acts as a much gentler NMDAR antagonist\nKetamine is therefore used in short blasts to try and reduce neuroinflammation quickly. Memantine does this very slowly over time - when glutamate spikes, memantine reduces the impact of these spikes\nIsabel’s PEM mixture:\nTaurine - 3g\nBerberine 550 Mg\nCreatine 5g\nInosine 1500 Mg\nDribose 5g\nMyo-d chiro 1 g\nThat’s the current formula per dose. Taken 2-3 times per day (one of those times before bed)\nBefore starting. Get a baseline of PEM frequency, duration and severity as well as what activities trigger PEM most reliably in order to measure success. I expect at least 2 weeks of consistent use to start to see results.\nFor the most severe, I don’t expect it to be super efficacious at preventing if only taken before an activity that generally triggers PEM but not sure wether or not it will decrease the duration/severity in that population if taken at the onset\nlumbar puncture:\n1/ poor wound healing, maybe require a lengthier stay than planned due to blood patch and longer recovery. Could make you worse just by extending stay\n2/ Blood vessels are a little fragile still, if you have dark bags under eyes - risk of injury at site\n3/ very small risk of brain injury if ICP is very high when they perform procedure\n4/ if you do have a CSF leak, it can cause low pressure and subsequent headache/symptoms"},"Notes/_priv-conv-dc":{"slug":"Notes/_priv-conv-dc","filePath":"content/Notes/_priv-conv-dc.md","title":"Conversation Excerpts: D.C.","links":[],"tags":["mecfs","testing"],"content":"Viral driver of ME (WTHHF)\nIn us humans it’s almost impossible with the approved antivirals to remove viral infections like EBV, CMV, HHV6 from the central nervous system.\nMost drugs don’t reach high enough concentrations anyways and those that do can only be used for a short time and only act on lytic infections anyways\nIf 90% (not saying that’s necessarily the case) of cells in the CNS are latently infected they will reactivate again and again and again from tiny triggers like hypoxic conditions, cytokine imbalances etc. Probably most people with severe  ME that persisted for more than a couple of years have ongoing triggers like tethered cord or genetic immune defects that lead to repeated reactivations anyways…\nOn top of it we can’t continuously take ultra high dosages of brain permeable antivirals… Valtrex doesn’t reach the brain in high enough concentrations.\nSome people with CMV might be lucky and tolerate Valcyte at very high dosages (not sure who ever tried it though). And there are success stories with antivirals from time to time, it’s just a rather small minority and there are loads of reasons for it that don’t have anything to do with the absence of infections nor the absence of negative effects of these infections…\nThen there are models for infection burden reduction with ongoing Valtrex use and it would take something like 11 years or so to remove most of the virus from the body even without further triggers and with a functional immune system as well as autophagy etc. … How should we ever get rid of massive viral Reservoirs in our tissues\nI strongly believe in the viral/infectious cause for many/most and I find it hilarious how some “top” researchers simply reject it because they can’t find active infection in the blood with PCR or because antivirals don’t work. Clearly they haven’t researched the mechanism and effects  of these antivirals and that isolated CNS infections are very common with the absence of IgM or PCR in the blood…\nObviously it could be wrong but to neglect it or put it off is not scientific with the current research. Quite the opposite. We have loads of results that point toward infections and no results yet that falsify an infectious hypothesis\nBut there seems to be an (in my opinion rather small) autoimmune subset and their ME definitely doesn’t primarily result from chronic infections\nCandida\nWe had an appointment with a specialist for chronic gut diseases and it was quite promising. After some special lab tests we found candida krusei after several tests in other labs, that only tested albicans (and we thought candida is not a problem). He said, he found krusei as a pathogen much more harmful than albicans. It is diagnosed via direct findings and the measuring of arabitinol as a metabolic product in the urine. So his patients  with unknown krusei often come with heavy burnouts improving after treatment. For now we should go with a round of Nystatin (pills and solution) for two weeks, maybe with another round of Itraconazol if it sits in the mucous layer. Will track success with arabinitol. So improved gut will be at least the outcome of the treatment,I guess. More will be reported.\n\nCandida krusei does NOT produce arabinitol.\nStudies show that D-arabinitol is produced by many Candida species such as Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis, but not by Candida krusei.\nMeasuring Arabinitol during C. Krusei Infection as a tracking or infection severity is pointless. It will only indirectly measure.other Candida species\n\nI second what [he] says.\nIf Arabinitol is increased there’s is some other type of yeast overgrowth. Krusei ist notoriously hard to eradicate and often times treatment resistent.

Also, it would be much better to take iron bound to heme by increasing red meat and liver.\nIf you want you can send me your iron-related tests results and I might give you better advice.\nTreatment approach\nNo single supplement or drug will move the needle. Only a holistic plan addressing the most important pathways will eventually work.\nWe don’t talk much about the basics here, but they are just as important—if not more—than any therapy.\nAfter years of mitochondrial failure and immunosuppression, we are full of toxins and infections, hidden deep in the tissues under different biofilms, difficult to reach.\nSpecific individual triggers need to be removed, such as mold (both environmental and internal), heavy metals, pesticides, etc. Once the body can handle it, we’ll need to eliminate these toxins (sauna, chelation, Epsom salt baths, binders…) and replenish the nutrients we normally lack (Mg²⁺, iodine, lithium, selenium, copper…).\nThe immune system is constantly creating autoantibodies and attacking self-tissues. Similarly, we have many autoreactive T cells that cause ongoing damage and inflammation. We’ll probably need to eliminate the long-lived plasma cells to break this part of the cycle.\nOur limbic system is stuck in an inflammatory state, sending danger signals to the periphery. If this doesn’t correct itself, we’ll need to intervene (transcranial ultrasound, peptides to reduce CRFR2, limbic system retraining—for milder cases, etc. ).\nWe also have plenty of alarmins in the blood and lymphatics perpetuating the disease, even in the absence of active infections (IFN-α, eATP, cardiolipin, mtDNA, PGE₂, TGF-Β1, kynunerin, succinate, etc.). These will need to be dealt with.\nThere is also excessive expression of viruses and retroviruses inserted in the DNA of somatic cells, constantly forming inflammatory microRNAs (HHV6, perhaps even XMRV or a related one, for sure lots of endogenous ERV which should be silent but they are not).\nThe gut is fermenting and leaky, continuously activating the immune system (T cells, B cells, mast cells, complement, etc.) and perpetuating the autoimmune response. Dysbiotic microbes produce toxins like LPS, D-lactate, ammonia, and alcohols that enter the bloodstream and inhibit mitochondria. This needs to be fixed (Dr Myhil’s protocol for fermenting gut is a great tool IMO).\nHere eliminating all immunigenic and fermenting foods is paramount, obviously.\nSo no, this is not an easy war we’ll win with a couple of drugs or supplements. We need a comprehensive strategy to address all these factors. But I am sure we can do it. In fact, in animal models this has already been done by targeting different pieces of the puzzle: anti-purinergics for chronic tuberculosis, sublingual vaccines for chronic hepatitis, transcranial ultrasound for chronic neuroglia and P2X7-mediated arrhythmia, rapamycin for sepsis or chronic HIV, glutamine inhibitors for chronic tuberculosis, genetic IRG1 inhibition to cure chronic plasmodium infections in mice, etc., etc.\nSo this has been done. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that what I am proposing is just theory—it has worked in simpler models. For us, it will simply require a much broader and holistic approach, along with a wise way to track progress and a lot of patience, because this will take time.\nSo please, do not lose hope. Objectively, there are already tools we can implement that can work. But we need to be smart, put the right plan together, and follow it through.\n…\nIf you had asked me this question two years ago, I would have said without a doubt that the purinergic receptor pathway is the most important. But both my partner and I spent a year and a half taking purinergic antagonists and, although the immune system improved significantly and we even tested negative for Lyme, we saw no significant clinical improvement. Similarly, mTOR sits at the center of everything, as multiple pathways converge on mTOR, and it is the main driver of mitochondrial dysfunction. The problem is that the reaction it produces is highly pro-inflammatory and very difficult to tolerate, and on its own it rarely cures, except in some rare cases. The ISR would also appear central, yet while stimulating it helps some patients, it is not a universal solution. The best results I have seen, by far, come from GcMAF, which improves roughly 70% of ME/CFS patients by about 50–70%—a remarkably high response rate. So this pathway appears to be truly fundamental. However When I reached a 70% functionality with GcMAF I was not fully recovered, so something was missing…\nOn paper, AHR looks essential and one of the main immunosuppressive mechanisms. In Long COVID, when you inhibit it, PBMCs come out of immune exhaustion and mitochondrial function is restored perfectly, but we have no idea how this will behave in vivo.\nWe can also infer that endorphin deficiency is very important, based on the clinical benefits of LDN and ODSMT/tianeptin in many patients. But we still do not know what might happen when endorphins are stimulated at the correct magnitude, multiplied by up to 300,000-fold, as with MENK.\nThe truth is, we don’t know. But what is clear is that we enter the illness with many pathways all moving in the same maladaptive direction, and it is likely that we will need to activate multiple pathways simultaneously to reverse that trajectory. That is why I am convinced we will ultimately need a multi-pathway approach.\n…\nYour last question is the million-dollar question. In vivo, monotherapies work very well in mice, where there are no confounding factors. For example, purinergic antagonists cure chronic tuberculosis, glutamine metabolism inhibitors also cure chronic tuberculosis, purinergic antagonists also cure chronic tuberculosis and, if I recall correctly, even HIV and sepsis. mTOR inhibitors cure sepsis and all kinds of infections as well. The problem is that in humans we are far more complex: we are older, have accumulated more toxic exposures, carry many chronic infections, and have far more complicating factors that make clearing these infections much harder. Monotherapies do work in some anecdotal cases that we are all familiar with, but not in the majority.\n…\nFurthermore, I tend to believe it is much more effective to address 10 very important targets simultaneously at low doses, than to focus on one alone with great intensity, since the body works synergistically through multiple pathways that feedback into one another. In my opinion, adding therapies that make sense and reverse the pathophysiology of the CDR that led you into immunosuppression essentially improves the state, and importantly, the self-regulation of the immune system.\nPEM cause\nYou ask very pertinent questions, and I will try to answer with my opinion, although evidently none of us has the definitive answer or we wouldn’t be here.\nTo begin with, what causes PEM? In my opinion, when one exerts beyond limits and oxidative phosphorylation cannot meet the energy demand, what happens is an increase in ATP synthesis through anaerobic pathways in the cytoplasm. In that context, as lactate is generated from pyruvate, more NADH is produced, which raises the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio and worsens mitochondrial reductive stress. This excess reducing power promotes reverse electron transport (RET) in the respiratory chain, causing electrons to flow backwards and react with molecular oxygen, generating free radicals. Thus, both alterations combine: on the one hand oxidative stress, and on the other reductive stress, which feed into each other and further inactivate the mitochondria.\nAs a consequence, more danger signals are released —such as extracellular ATP, mitochondrial DNA, etc.— which hyperactivate the immune system. This explains why PEM lasts 3 or 4 days, characterized by increased inflammation and, in general terms, the entry of immune and non-immune somatic cells into CDR1 —as Naviaux has published. Altogether this leads to a global worsening, since inflammatory molecules reach the vagus nerve, transmit the signal to the brain, and the brain generates the sensation of fatigue, in addition to sending inhibitory signals to the mitochondria and the periphery, reinforcing that state during those days.\nAs for what directly causes the symptoms of the illness, we can extrapolate from animal models: What happens when you inject ATP into a mouse? The energetic efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation automatically drops by more than 70%. Therefore, we know that extracellular ATP, or any alarmin that activates the CDR, will induce fatigue. This energy failure translates into a wide range of anomalies: brain fog, digestive problems, disruption of the gastrointestinal and blood–brain barriers, orthostatic hypotension due to lack of energy to maintain blood pressure, as well as immune failure that allows the proliferation of previously controlled infections, among many others.\nThis same state can also be induced with TGF-β1, with LPS, with TNFα, with PGE2, with IFNα (in fact you can really cause CFS with this one), with acute or chronic infections, with toxins such as heavy metals or pesticides, with radiation, or even with overtraining. In all cases the result converges on the same: a generalized CDR state with a marked decrease in mitochondrial efficiency and immunosuppression, with chronic low-level inflammation.\nThe central part of the nervous system implicated in the symptoms is mainly the limbic system. In it, structures such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate cortex and also the nucleus accumbens react to excess inflammation. This activation triggers what is called sickness behavior, which constitutes an essential part of why we feel ill, beyond the peripheral mitochondrial failure at the tissue level.\nAs to which of the mechanisms has greater importance, it is difficult to know. As you know, there are people with a very autoimmune profile who respond very well to Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis or IVIgs, while others do not. This explains why some people can have remarkable remissions by targeting a single piece, as with rapamycin, itraconazole, cervical instability surgery, etc.\nTherefore, it is not that within 24 hours the pathogenic or toxic load suddenly worsens. What happens is the triggering of an acute mitochondrial failure together with an entry into CDR1, characterized by increased inflammation that sends signals to the brain. The brain interprets the situation as greater risk and translates it into a more intense sensation of fatigue.\nTreatment attempts\nAs for opioids, μ-opioid agonists are the most effective symptomatically because they act at the central node where the perception of fatigue (limbic system), brain inflammation (microglia), vagal danger signaling, and peripheral immune modulation converge. They do not repair mitochondrial dysfunction, but they “silence” the alarm and the sickness behavior response, allowing the patient to feel better while the effect lasts.\nIn the same way, dopaminergic activation with amphetamines also decreases sickness behavior, transiently reducing fatigue and other symptoms, although without correcting the underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. I suppose aripiprazole can be included here as well. But all this is merely symptomatic.\nAs for why CNS depressants work in certain patients with sensory hyperactivation, the explanation is simple: they regulate the GABA/glutamate balance. In this way symptoms are reduced, although without addressing the root of the problem.\nThe problem with testing different drugs that might show some benefits is that most do not target the origin of the disease and therefore will never cure it. In fact, many therapies that truly work causally tend to worsen symptoms at first, because escaping immunosuppression implies going through an initial immune activation that is very unpleasant and aggravates symptoms. Therefore, it is important to investigate therapies that help patients, but always filtering which are merely symptomatic—which are also valuable!!! —and which have the potential to go to the root of the problem, which in my opinion is essentially immunological.\nIn reality, if you think about it, we should have considered μ-receptor activators a long time ago. Since it became known that LDN is possibly what works best in population terms in CFS and fibromyalgia, we should have deduced that, by increasing beta-endorphins and MENK, neuroglial activation is reduced (something that in fact has been demonstrated), and the immune system is activated through μ, δ and OGFr receptors. Actually we do have low methione levels probably because of the methylation issues (part of the CDR), so it makes sense that we cannot synthesize 5-methionine-enkephalin (MENK). This is something that could have been discovered earlier.\nOf course, I am not ruling out that we may find new pathways. One example is the link between kynurenine and the AHR, and how this contributes to immunosuppression by increasing TGF-β and in turn activating the Janus kinase pathway, IL-6, etc.—a mechanism known only relatively recently. Another similar case is itaconate: until a few years ago it was considered an irrelevant metabolite, and the studies identifying it as a key immunometabolic regulator are only 4 or 5 years old.\nIn other words, new pathways continue to emerge, and we must always be vigilant to discover important mechanisms involved in both the CDR and immunosuppression.\nIn all cases, in AD there is usually an underlying mitochondrial failure that can be addressed with holistic therapies: deep ketosis, infrared and red LED light, transcranial ultrasound, reducing fermentable gut content (which produces toxins that can reach the brain via the vagus nerve), eliminating lectin-containing foods, heavy metal detoxification, and elimination of mold—both of which have been found in all Alzheimer’s brains STUDIED. The results of these strategies are truly remarkable.\nOh! And Borrelia burgdorferi has benn shown in virtually all AD brains… So no drug for reducing beta amyloid or TAU is going to work…\nTherefore, in the same way, in CFS/ME a holistic plan is required that goes to the root, and not simply trying hundreds of different drugs that in most cases will achieve nothing.\nHerpes testing\nIt is very useful to have both lytic and latent antigens. It might tell you whether you could benefit or not from traditional antivirals\n\nPretty interesting as oral testing was apparently (according to lab professor) introduced by NASA to test more accuarately and it seems to be the gold standard now for studies that examime EBV (for example the one I participated in 2021)\nHowever I think certain viruses are almost impossible to catch reactivation of CMV, HHV6-8, VZV (unless outer signs) - and these need a combined approach with Titers and iga + igm testing.\nSame with ParvovirusB19 which is one of the most frequent non Herpes ME/CFS viruses.\nIn my case the 60% of EBV was never replicated at least in my own samples.\nAnd very interesting that HHV6 was never positive ever for me in blood and saliva testing despite immense titers. 17.1% Chance in healthy should have given me some bonus ahead lol.\nSo yeah in my special case, luckily the PCR testing seems to match the actual happenings.\nIts quite easy to tell now for me personally when certain symptoms arrive - doing PCR testing and being positive.\nNasa testing viral EBV Shedding:\nIncreased EBV Shedding in Astronaut Saliva During Spaceflight\nntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110000846\nIt might also depend on the quality of the kits , cut off limit (very important!) etc, not sure how much has changed here quality wise.\nMethylene blue\nHydrogen peroxide is far less reactive than superoxide, so shifting the balance toward H₂O₂ can actually protect cells. Methylene blue accepts the surplus electrons that normally leak from complexes I, II and III and transfers them directly to molecular oxygen, forming H₂O₂ instead of letting those electrons create superoxide. Less superoxide means less peroxynitrite, because superoxide must combine with nitric oxide to generate that highly destructive species. The small rise in H₂O₂ that follows is quickly neutralised by glutathione peroxidase and related enzymes, so the net effect is a cleaner redox environment, not added oxidative stress.\nWhen we look at the whole picture—where mitochondrial membrane potential recovers, ATP output rises and oxidative markers fall—the data consistently show improvement, even in the high-dose in-vitro experiments where H₂O₂ goes up. Those conditions exaggerate exposure far beyond what anyone would use therapeutically, yet they still do not report mitochondrial damage or an overall pro-oxidant shift. Context therefore matters: methylene blue at sensible doses reduces the most harmful radicals and supports mitochondrial function rather than impairing it.\nThe hormetic effect of methylene blue is not the classic type—where, for example, you administer an oxidant that activates NRF2 and boosts glutathione levels. In this context, I agree with you that it’s useless for CFS.\nHere, the idea is that methylene blue is hormetic because at low doses it reduces excessive oxidative stress, while at high doses it acts as a pro-oxidant. In other words, low doses are beneficial and high doses are harmful. Still, the nature of this effect differs greatly from the typical hormetic response usually cited for many other substances.\nIt won’t create H2O2 at low doses. Actually it should reduce it. Even at medium-high doses H2O2 might increse but the total redox status is improved. It is only at very high doses that MB is pro-oxidant, which could help in certain acute infections.\nThis is a high dose of 10 mg per kg in a murine trial that effectively increased the NAD⁺/NADH ratio, improving mitochondrial function. However, I believe this is a high dose, and there is evidence that between 25 and 70 mg per day for a 70 kg person should also work, since in the same study, for example, doses of 3 mg per kg were also effective, though not as much. Therefore, I understand that up to 70–80 mg per day, if tolerated, could be safe but I’d start at 20 mg/day and increase slowly.\nRegarding the microbiome, mouse studies support that it improves up to human-equivalent doses of approximately 1.2 mg per kg, while very high doses around 4 mg per kg lead to a worsening of the microbiome. At the doses we’re discussing, methylene blue appears to enhance microbiome balance and increase biodiversity.\nLet me clarify. There is a study with rats where doses of 10 and 3 mg/kg were successful in increasing the NAD+/NADH  ratio, and in improving all mitochondrial measurements.\nThis translates into human equivalent doses of  0.48 and 1.6 mg/kg.\nMitophagy vs danger signals\nI agree with O3 — you need fission to initiate mitophagy, and later on, mitochondrial biogenesis is activated to restore mitochondrial mass.\nHowever, these processes are downstream and should be orchestrated by the mitochondria themselves once they perceive a safe and permissive environment.\nThat’s why, in my opinion, the priority is to reduce danger signals.\nI understand that some people may feel better by stimulating mitophagy, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, or inhibiting DRP1. But in severe, long-term ME/CFS patients, we are likely in a state of deep exhaustion where mitochondria remain predominantly fused. In such a context, stimulating mitophagy might simply not be feasible, even if artificially induced — and promoting biogenesis may backfire by increasing ROS and oxidative stress.\nIndeed, as long as mTOR remains elevated, the process will be unproductive. But again, mTOR is upregulated for a reason — primarily via purinergic receptor signaling,  through ER stress pathways (ATF6/Rheb), increased ROS and NO, TLRs, or directly in response to mitochondrial damage.\nIn chronic settings such as immunosuppression, low-grade inflammation, or cellular senescence, mTOR activity remains persistently high. Elevated mTORC1 suppresses mitophagy by phosphorylating ULK1/ATG13, thereby blocking autophagosome initiation, and by retaining TFEB in the cytosol, which limits lysosome biogenesis. Although local PINK1-Parkin signalling can still tag damaged mitochondria, the incomplete autophagic flux leads to poor clearance.\nRapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors restore mitophagy under these conditions, which proves the link between mTOR and mitophagy\nUltrasound therapy\nSome time ago, a colleague asked me the exact same question, and this was the summary I shared with him about how I came to the conclusion that transcranial ultrasound might be a useful tool. I honestly don’t know whether to expect a strong therapeutic effect—but I do know that the idea makes conceptual sense.\nOne key insight is that different forms of “memory” can trap the body in a chronic pathological state. One of them is clearly immunological. Another lies in the physical structure and electrochemical state of cell membranes. But there’s also a third—and often overlooked—form: neurological memory.\nA powerful illustration of this is phantom limb pain, where a person continues to feel pain in a limb that no longer exists. The pain isn’t coming from the body, but from persisting activity in brain circuits that no longer reflect reality. The nervous system, in effect, remembers the illness or injury, and replays it.\nEven more compelling are recent animal studies showing that if you induce a physical illness in a mouse—for example, an intestinal infection—and record the specific neural circuits that become active during that disease, you can later artificially reactivate those same circuits in a healthy mouse, and it will begin to display the same physical symptoms, even though there is no ongoing infection or pathology. This shows that certain patterns of neural activity are sufficient to recreate disease states, even when the original cause is gone.\nhere is how I came to the conclusion that it could work:\nI was studying the effects of pulsed ultrasound on the spleen to boost the immune system, and I came across a study that really caught my attention. In this study, applying ultrasound to the hypothalamus reversed a ventricular arrhythmia, which I found quite fascinating. That led me to start exploring transcranial ultrasound.I recalled studies on CT38, where it’s explained that elevated levels of urocortins, or in this case CRFR2, which would be chronically activated along with chronically elevated serotonin levels, could perpetuate a chronic dysfunctional and inflammatory state in the hypothalamus and amygdala.\nThis made me wonder if there could be a link between ultrasound and conditioned fear. Indeed, I found another study, which I’m attaching, that shows focused transcranial ultrasound targeting the hypothalamus can reduce conditioned fear responses in mice. So, I began looking for more information and found that while most research is focused on ultrasound targeting the hypothalamus, there are a couple of studies in Alzheimer’s disease where transcranial ultrasound was applied to the entire skull, showing good results.\nBased on this and numerous studies on transcranial ultrasound for conditions like depression, anxiety, and various central nervous system disorders, I decided to commission the construction of an ultrasound device with the required specifications, making sure the power level is appropriate to avoid to fry my brain…\nIn addition to all this, I had read a study some time ago where they found, for the first time, the neurological switches of inflammation in the nuclei of the solitary tract in the brainstem. In this study, inflammation caused by LPS disappeared when these nuclei were chemically inhibited. Later, I discovered a study where ultrasound, in this case applied to the brainstem, managed to reduce inflammation caused by hypertension in mice, which I’m also attaching.\nTherefore, my goal is to test ultrasound not only on the hypothalamus and amygdala but also on the brainstem…\nI agree! That’s why I am going to try the transcraneal ultrasound, because it could promote a similar un-blocking effect without the risks of the CT38\nHypometabolism markers\nHypometabolism is shown in many blood/urine markers such as low blood lactate, low temperature,  low urine aspartate, high urine succinate/fumarate ratio, high TSH, or exhausted immunity including high PGE2, high TGF-beta1, low NK lytic activity, low mRNA perforins, low CD3-CD57+, low IL-12, low IFN gamma, high IL-10, high IL-5, low total IgGs, etc.\nEven low uric acid could indicate hypometabolism. Or low blood aminoacids, with low/normal acute phase reactants inflammatory markers such as HS-CRP, ESR, ferritin or fibrinogen…\nBaking soda test\nThere’s a supposed home test, you could look it up. In a nutshell, add some baking soda to a glass of water and down it. If you burp within a couple minutes, you have adequate stomach acid. If you don’t, then starting with a tiny bit, take some apple cider vinegar/ water  and see if it’s tolerated. But in my case, I don’t burp but the vinegar  will fry me. Y M M V…\nCDR overview\nTo answer this question, we first need to define what CDR is. CDR is not a theory, nor is it something random. It is a classification of states that all cells in the body enter when facing stress more severe than usual. It consists of three states that always occur in the same order. First, CDR1, characterized by inflammation and a significant reduction in oxidative phosphorylation, which is linked to innate immunity in immune cells. Then, CDR2, which is based on proliferation, where mitochondrial function begins to improve. Finally, CDR3, where mitochondrial function is nearly normal, metabolic functions are almost restored, but there is still the need to reconnect with other cells and the central nervous system.\nIn this regard, all diseases have a higher proportion of one of these three states. In acute infections, there will logically be a predominance of inflammatory CDR1, while diseases such as cancer, fibrotic diseases, or diabetes will be dominated by CDR2. In autoimmune diseases, CDR3A is typically predominant, whereas fatigue-related conditions fall under a subtype called CDR3B, which is characterized by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, glycolysis impairment, high NADH, low lactate, and other metabolic disturbances unique to this CDR3B state.\nTherefore, CDR is neither a theory nor something that applies solely to ME/CFS. It consists of measurable, universal states in which all diseases can be categorized, although there will always be cells in each of the three states.\nWhat determines which state we are in or what disease we end up with? It is evidently a matter of the initial insult itself. For example, if you get infected with COVID, you will have CDR1. If you contract a chronic infection, you may enter CDR1 and sometime CDR3B (like CFS) . If you develop diabetes, CDR2 will predominate. Thus, the cause is highly important.\nAnother crucial factor is your HLA type—how well your antigen-presenting cells can present antigens. If you are unlucky and get exposed to mold or Epstein-Barr virus while carrying HLA-DR15 (I believe this is the one) or other less efficient HLA types, your MHC class II molecules will struggle with antigen presentation, leading to immune exhaustion. Therefore, genetic factors in antigen recognition and presentation are fundamental.\nAdditionally, the location of infections plays a key role. Depending on whether infections are present in the vagus nerve, immune cells, or specific regions of the brain, you will develop different diseases. If CDR occurs in cells of the brain’s substantia nigra, for example, you will develop Parkinson’s.\nThere is also the issue of antigenic stimulation. Autoimmune diseases often originate in the gut due to intestinal permeability, where bacterial and dietary antigens come into contact with the immune system or, through molecular mimicry, trigger autoimmunity since these antigens do not induce immune tolerance. As a result, autoimmune symptoms develop. However, if the issue is bacteria that stimulate the immune system through LPS, or if there is bacterial translocation with high levels of LPS, these will actually induce immune tolerance. Similarly, herpesviruses are known to develop strategies that promote immune tolerance. This means that the infectious agent itself will shape the symptomatology in one direction or another depending on the nature of the antigenic stimulus.\nAnd finally, there is another very interesting evolutionary aspect. For example, people who tend to develop obesity do not actually have a problem in a fundamental sense. In the past, they would have been the ones most likely to survive during periods of famine. Similarly, it is possible that those of us who have developed ME/CFS actually have a much greater ability to contain viruses at the unicellular level compared to others. In the past, this might have given us a significant advantage in facing epidemics, whereas today, with the overwhelming toxic and pathogenic burden, it may simply be too much, leading us to illness.\nLastly, genetic variability, or heterogenetic variability, likely predisposes individuals to different diseases—that is, to different CDR states—depending on the interaction of thousands of genes, which we are currently completely incapable of fully understanding.\nWhat is CDR? \nWe need to define the Cell Danger Response (CDR) properly. CDR refers to all the known and described mechanisms that a cell activates whenever it encounters any stressor that pushes it out of its homeostatic state. Therefore, it is not a “possible component” that may or may not exist or be relevant to disease. Rather, it is simply the collective name for all the mechanisms that are switched on under stress. In other words, whenever there is disease, there is CDR.\nI take as a starting point that ME/CFS is initially triggered by stressors—mainly infections and toxins. The order doesn’t matter, since both immunosuppress you, generate oxidative stress, and drive cells into a CDR state. One leads to the other and viceversa.\nInfections, for their part—all of them—when they become chronic, activate the same immunosuppressive mechanisms to prevent clearance. These mechanisms are well known and well described. This is why you can theorize, and indeed observe in studies, that by altering or reversing these mechanisms you can exit the state of immunosuppression and overcome the infection.\nWhen cells are infected or exposed to any other type of stress—be it toxins, mycotoxins, radiation (ionizing or non-ionizing), oxidative stress, or even physical or psychological stress—the mechanisms that are activated are also known and fall under CDR. This means we can identify the main biochemical targets that need to be addressed.\nThis is especially evident in immune cells: repeated exposure to LPS, for example, drives them into exhaustion, and you can study in detail all the physiological changes that occur to confirm these mechanisms. But the same can be reproduced in uninfected cells by exposing them to free radicals, cytokines, radiation, or DNA mutations, which trigger the same pathways, though in this case generating senescent cells. These mechanisms are also well described.\nTherefore, it is not as random as it might seem: by looking at how a cell becomes exhausted and progresses through the three stages of CDR, and which metabolic pathways are altered, you realize that the number of possible outcomes is finite and they are always the same.\nFrom here, we can broaden or narrow the perspective. At the cellular level, we find the same well-described alterations corresponding to CDR1 and/or to CDR3A/hypometabolism. At the systemic level, the immune system becomes central, since its state is what matters most, and its profile is well understood and measurable.\nThe connection with the central nervous system during CDR is also known: sympathetic activity increases, parasympathetic activity decreases, and so on. From this, we can deduce the likely CNS state, and in this way we can go step by step from the cell to the whole organism, describing all the systemic abnormalities that Naviaux documented in his writings, including hormones, metabolome, microbiome, etc. Everything is connected and stems from the same chronic un-resolved cellular stress, affecting different tissues.\nCDR and reductive stress\nIf you look at the Naviaux paper describing what cells do under CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, the transition we observe—from an inflammatory state with high NK cell activity and a Th1/Th17 response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial fission, elevated antioxidant response, and even high NAD+ levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, or lactate levels, to a state with reduced inflammation, low NK activity, a predominant Th2 response, reductive stress, low lactate, low GSH, low NAD+, and mitochondrial hyperfusion—clearly reflects a progression from a CDR1-like state to a more CDR3a-like state.\nIt’s essentially the same pattern that occurs when CD8+ T cells, NK cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells are repeatedly stimulated with LPS; they undergo the same type of transition.\nSorry [x] , I think I missed replying to your message? , and if I did reply, I will update it now. I have been trying to research and compare the causes of reductive stress between obesity and immune cell exhaustion to understand where ME/CFS would fit better.\nIn obesity, the main driver of reductive stress is a very high electron flow through glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, primarily caused by insulin via the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which leads to the induction of enzymes consuming NAD+ such as PPARs, as well as the synthesis of IDO, which converts tryptophan into kynurenine, thereby further activating AHR. Additionally, enzymes like CD38 are also induced, further depleting NAD⁺ levels.\nThe excess electron flow leads to over-reduction of coenzyme Q (CoQ), causing electron leakage from Complexes I, II, and III, reducing oxygen to superoxide (O₂⁻), which in turn reacts with nitric oxide (NO) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻). Both NO and ONOO⁻ inhibit mitochondrial complexes. Moreover, ONOO⁻ also increases PPAR expression, further depleting NAD⁺.\nIn obesity, there is also a characteristic pattern where the high electron flux from fatty acid oxidation leads to elevated acetyl-CoA levels, causing hyperacetylation of mitochondrial complexes, including NNT (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase), which further inhibits NADH oxidation.\nIn ME/CFS, the mechanisms are similar, as there are elevated levels of IDO2, activation of AHR, high kynurenine levels, and clear signs of reductive stress, along with high levels of peroxynitrite and possibly increased nitrosative reactions involving NO and peroxynitrite. However, as occurs in exhausted immune cells, sustained high levels of IFN-α lead to PD-1 activation. PD-1 is a major inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Initially, in cells beginning to exhaust, glycolysis decreases while FAO increases. A similar pattern is observed in ME/CFS: early stages show increased FAO, but as the disease progresses, FAO declines, leading to decreased acetyl-CoA production, just like in severely exhausted cells.\nThis decrease in acetyl-CoA is critical because it impairs the expression of pro-inflammatory genes like IL-6 and IL-1β, preventing immune cells from performing their functions properly, in addition to maintaining mitochondrial inhibition.\nAnother key mechanism behind reductive stress in ME/CFS is the elevated flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), since glycolytic flux, particularly at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), is inhibited. This leads to decreased bioavailability of BH₄ (tetrahydrobiopterin), resulting in uncoupling of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increased superoxide production, and worsening of the overall redox imbalance.\nAll of these processes are downstream events secondary to the activation of purinergic receptors, mTOR, or IFN-α signaling.\nFor instance, the initial stimulus driving high electron flux through glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in activated immune cells is mTOR, which is itself activated by purinergic receptors. Moreover, both purinergic receptors and mTOR stimulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to itaconate production and PD-1 upregulation, contributing to reductive stress and, ultimately, mitochondrial dysfunction.\nTherefore, and sorry for the long answer to your question, while reductive stress is indeed a key mechanism underlying mitochondrial failure at the biochemical level, I am uncertain whether addressing such a downstream point would be sufficient to reverse the upstream signaling that maintains the chronic CDR state.\nNevertheless, mechanistically, I find this drug very promising because it seems to act as a redox cycling agent: it reduces itself to oxidize NADH into NAD⁺ and then reoxidizes, repeating this cycle continuously until it is eventually eliminated from the body. I think this is a very smart mechanism that could be highly effective.\nHowever, in a context of persistent chronic infections, chronic inflammation, continuous TLRs and PRRs activation, and ongoing IFN-α and purinergic signaling, I am unsure whether simply increasing the NAD⁺/NADH ratio would be enough to reverse the overall process. I am genuinely eager to see whether it can. Therefore, I strongly encourage you guys to test it, and to do so for a sufficiently long period to allow clear effects to manifest.\nFor example, in obesity, therapies targeting NAD⁺ restoration are effective in reducing insulin resistance, oxidative excess, and AHR overactivation, among other improvements.\nSure, NRF2 would contribute to more reductive stress.\nThe reductive stress at the mitochondrial level will cause electron leakage which will reduce 02 forming superoxide that will be converted into H2O2 or peroxinitrite, highly reactive.\nSo essentially, the reductive stress at the mitochondrial membrane (and also in the cytosol as seen by high NADH and NADPH) will create ROS and RNS that explain the oxidative and Nitrosative damage observed in ME/CFS.\nThis explains why many studies does not find low GSH levels but instead normal or even higher levels\nThe problem is that we have a high NADH/NAD⁺ ratio.\nIf we take NAD⁺, it will accept an electron from glucose oxidation and become NADH, but then it will remain stuck in that reduced state, unable to transfer the electron to the mitochondrial electron transport chain to regenerate ATP.\nInstead, it will over-reduce CoQ that will send the electrons backwards and will leak and react with excess and unused oxygen to form superoxide (what is called reverses electron transport), worsening the whole picture.\nThe issue isn’t NAD⁺ itself. What we need is for the mitochondria to initiate oxidative phosphorylation properly—begin transferring electrons efficiently, establish the correct proton gradient, and then reduce oxygen to eventually phosphorylate ADP into ATP.\nThis is fundamentally a mitochondrial signaling problem.\nYeah, I think they got it backwards. When there is immune-suppression, tryptophan/kynurenine ratio DECREASES, as seen in the study of long covid patients and Inhibiting EITHER AHR OR TDO2 reverts this, breaking the immune-suppressive vicious cycle:\ninflammation/IDO/kynurenine/AhR/TGF-Β1/IL6/JNK1/STAT3/kynurenine…\nI really like TDO2 as a target, but unfortunately I didn’t find any suitable compound for our hamsters1\nI had another long talk with Ron Davis 2 days ago, here are some of my notes (they may not be perfect, I couldn’t catch everything):\nLast week, Ron Davis, Rob Phair, and Laurel Crosby were talking, and they think they have a good idea about what is going on in PEM specifically.\nROS oxidizes BH4 to BH2, and now you can’t dilate blood vessels because you need BH4 to do this, and BH4 is also needed for other critical things like dopamine synthesis, …\nThis decrease in BH4 could be delayed because it could a while for the oxidation to happen, which could explain why PEM is often delayed.\nAnd it gets oxidated into nitrate. There are old publications about how heavy exercise leads to high nitrate levels.\nSo essentially, for PEM at least, Ron and those think decreasing ROS could be the most important target to address PEM.\nThis would help but it is a downstream bandaid. It all comes down to too much NADH and too low NAD+, caused by many factors, such as too much food in obesity,  infections in ME/CFS directly by activating PARP-1 or indirectly by continuously stimulating the immune system causing too much electrons going backwards and generating ROS, or inflammation stimulating IDO/kynurenine/AHR that will consume NAD+ by activating more IDO, CD38, PARP-1 etc.\nThis reductive stress at the mitochondria creates NO, peroxinitrite, itaconate, excess acetylation… That will inhibit mitochondrial complexes.\nToo much NADH will generate too much NADPH. Also, the glycolytic flux is impared, and the flux through the Pentose Phosphate pathway is increased, creating more NADPH, contributing to higher reductive stress and further oxidative stress as a consequence.\nInhibiting AHR is an efficient way to stop this cycle IMO. Also, inhibiting the PPP (with RRX001) seems like a good idea to me.\nAnything that oxidizes NADH into NAD+ will help revert this process. And booting the immune system lowering the microbial burden in the first place seems paramount.\nWith that said, I’ll research those molecules in case you can help revert the reductive stress by impeding the electron leakage…  It would be great if they would increase NAD+/NADH!\nAccording to Ron Davis and other researchers, measuring BH4 is very difficult because it degrades rapidly, like in 1h!\nRegarding the levels found in ME/CFS, exactly: one team has reported elevated BH4 levels, while Ron Davis’s group appears to have found them low. But in any case, it doesn’t really matter. The key point is that in the study where both BH4 and BH2 were found to be very high due to an increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, the authors explain that the result of reductive stress is the leakage of electrons from the early mitochondrial complexes. These electrons then generate superoxide, which reacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite. This, in turn, reacts with BH4 to produce BH3 and BH2. The excess BH2 competes with BH4 at the iNOS enzyme, preventing its proper coupling, which requires BH4. As a result, iNOS becomes uncoupled and produces even more superoxide, perpetuating the cycle.\nFurthermore, oxidative overload lowers the SAMe-to-SAH ratio, decreasing the formation of 5-MTHF, which further impairs iNOS coupling. Therefore, whether actual BH4 levels are high or low is not so important. What truly matters is that iNOS becomes uncoupled, producing excessive ROS and RNS, and this—together with the mitochondrial reductive stress that causes electrons to leak from complexes I, II, and III, forming superoxide that reacts with nitric oxide—perpetuates the vicious cycle. This leads to inefficient iNOS, low or poorly bioavailable BH4, and all the associated consequences, such as low levels of catecholamines, serotonin, endogenous opioids, and so on.\nIt won’t be a cure or else we all would know! But I like the combo of ALA, MB, TMS and RRX-001 to directly address the reductive stress that, in the end is probably where all the mitochondrial shutdown starts…\nA central issue in sepsis-induced immunosuppression is cellular energy depletion and lymphocyte death caused by ROS overload and massive PARP-1 activation. As a PARP inhibitor, BGP-15 preserves intracellular NAD⁺ levels, preventing the catastrophic drop in ATP that leads to cell death under severe inflammation. Additionally, by intercalating into and stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, BGP-15 reduces excessive free radical production from the respiratory chain, limiting oxidative danger signals that would otherwise trigger pro-apoptotic pathways and NF-κB. Indeed, BGP-15 has been shown to decrease ROS generation at mitochondrial complexes I and III, protecting cells from oxidative damage and necrosis. This oxidative stress reduction impacts key immune signaling pathways: it limits overactivation of inflammatory MAPKs (JNK, p38) and transcription factors like NF-κB and AP-1, while positively modulating cytoprotective regulators such as NRF2. Functionally, these actions may result in reduced harmful cytokine production and improved immune cell survival during sepsis or other chronic inflammation scenarios.\nSome viral infections take advantage of the stimulation of pathways that lead to antioxidant synthesis for their survival. To achieve this, they sometimes activate the pentose phosphate pathway, or they stimulate the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) to induce chaperone production and activate NRF2, thereby promoting the synthesis of antioxidants and chaperones to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress, which could otherwise kill them.\nSimilarly, some infections stimulate apoptosis in order to reproduce and spread the infection to other cells, while others inhibit apoptosis and promote autophagy to replicate within the host cell. Therefore, in vitro studies using certain infections cannot be directly extrapolated to a much more complex in vivo system, where infections are confined to specific cell types and the immune system plays a central role in eliminating these infected cells regardless of what a drug might do to an isolated cell.\nA very clear example is rapamycin, which is a strong immune stimulator. At the single-cell level, it inhibits replication of some infections while enhancing others. But systemically, it consistently stimulates the immune system — and that is what matters most.\nIn this sense, stimulating the chaperone Hsp70 is generally immunostimulatory, as it activates cellular repair mechanisms and inhibits processes that suppress oxidative phosphorylation. This leads to improved mitochondrial function and, from an immunological perspective, better overall immune cell performance, helping them to recover from immune exhaustion.\n(In response to the question M asked me on Mattermost, I’m replying here for greater visibility and because this is the most appropriate place to do so).\n*** M’s question:\n“Conversely, when NF-κB is activated by inflammatory stimuli, it can inhibit AhR by interfering with its dimerization with ARNT, thereby limiting AhR-driven gene expression. This mutual inhibition establishes a regulatory balance between immune responses and xenobiotic signaling. However, when AhR activation dominates, such as in response to dioxin exposure, the suppression of NF-κB contributes to immunosuppression, reducing inflammation independently of direct effects on immune cells.”\nWhat could this mean for the Bezisterim (Orally active partial NF-κB inhibitor) trial in conjunction with TMS or without TMS?\nI think many people have purchased both molecules.\n*** My answer:\nThat’s a very good question, so I’m going to answer it with as much detail as I can to explain the reasoning behind my position. That said, I really hope I’m wrong and that the therapy proves to be effective. I’ll be following your experience with NF-κB pathway inhibition with great interest!!\nIn ME/CFS, as you know, the early phase of the illness is typically characterized by a predominantly pro-inflammatory immune profile. Most immune cells display a CDR1-like state, marked by high activation of NF-κB and the inflammasome, which results in a strong Th1/Th17 cytokine response. During this phase, inflammatory mediators such as interferon-α, interferon-γ, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-8 are often elevated.\nHowever, as the disease progresses—and especially in patients with longer duration and more severe phenotypes—there is a transition toward a state of immune exhaustion, more consistent with a CDR3a signature, as described by Naviaux. In this phase, key cytotoxic cell types like CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells, which are crucial for antiviral and antitumor defense, show reduced expression of canonical NF-κB, reflecting their exhausted functional state.\nInterestingly, the myeloid lineage, including monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, does not show full suppression of NF-κB. Rather, they appear to undergo a functional rewiring. Although the classical pro-inflammatory NF-κB outputs—such as IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-12—are largely downregulated, monocytes maintain a modified NF-κB signaling profile, often involving non-canonical dimers like RelB/p52 or p50:p50, which continue to drive the production of chemokines such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), and in some cases CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL9 (MIG), and CCL2 (MCP-1), despite the suppression of classical high-energy pro-inflammatory cytokines\nGiven that macrophages and dendritic cells are more directly exposed to persistent stimulation by TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors, they remain in a state of chronic low-grade activation, secreting chemokines that contribute to ongoing inflammation. However, the lack of corresponding Th1-driving cytokines means that the CD8⁺ and NK compartments do not receive adequate activation signals, thus perpetuating immune dysfunction.\nIt’s also important to consider that myeloid cells secrete far more cytokines per cell than lymphocytes. Therefore, in some patients and in published studies, we may observe elevated plasma levels of IL-8 or CXCL10, which could be misinterpreted as reflecting strong immune activation. In reality, these levels may simply reflect baseline chemokine leakage from tolerised or semi-activated monocytes, rather than genuine inflammatory escalation.\nRegarding the interaction between AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) and NF-κB, it makes mechanistic sense that they are mutually antagonistic—one promoting anti-inflammatory tolerance and the other driving inflammatory gene programs. When AHR activity predominates, as may be the case in ME/CFS, it correlates with suppression of NF-κB, which may partially explain the immune system’s failure to mount appropriate responses.\nAs for the idea of directly inhibiting NF-κB, I agree it could make sense in early-stage disease, when the immune system is in a hyper-inflammatory, CDR1-type state. In this phase, excessive NF-κB activation may in fact contribute to the later collapse of immune function. Therefore, perhaps pulsed NF-κB inhibition might help mitigate that inflammatory burden and prevent future exhaustion.\nHowever, in chronic, advanced ME/CFS with clear immunological exhaustion, I believe that NF-κB inhibition may be counterproductive. By further suppressing NF-κB, especially in already exhausted cytotoxic cells, we may risk exacerbating immunosuppression and further diminishing the host’s ability to respond to latent viral antigens or other immunological challenges.\nThat said, I do acknowledge that inhibiting NF-κB in myeloid cells might relieve some of the low-grade, chemokine-driven inflammation, and this could lead to short-term symptom improvement. Still, I’m concerned that this might not be durable, and that stopping the drug could result in a rebound of pathogenic systemic activity.\nOf course, I sincerely hope I’m wrong. We’ve seen how some immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory interventions have led to  clinical improvement in ME/CFS. So these hypotheses remain theoretical, and as always in this field, reality often surprises us. Let’s hope this is one of those cases.\nSepsis begins with a highly inflammatory component in response to a systemic infection, where the immune system is in CDR1 with very high extracellular ATP levels, interferon-alpha, inflammatory cytokines, etc. This causes all these mechanisms, after a few days or several weeks, to rapidly shift into the immunosuppressive phase, since it is the same inflammatory mechanisms that ultimately drive the final immunosuppressive phase, characterized by immune system exhaustion. The parallel with CFS is clear, as the patterns are very similar in terms of exhausted immune cells, an inability to mount an immune response, very low levels of inflammatory cytokines, evident mitochondrial failure, reductive stress, etc. It is as if CFS were a form of sepsis but at a chronic level.\nExactly as I explained in my message, given that we are in a phase of immune exhaustion, it is much more difficult to mount an appropriate, acute response to viral or bacterial infections.\nAs for neutrophils, their numbers may be normal or slightly elevated in some cases, but since neutrophils primarily reflect the innate response to an acute infection, they are not particularly relevant in our case. However, there are indeed indications that functionally they are also exhausted.\nThe CDR protects individual cells from viruses and bacteria and is very powerful in acute scenarios. However, when the infection becomes chronic, the CDR becomes counterproductive. If the affected cell is a tissue cell, it will no longer perform its normal functions and will instead secrete alarm signals, spreading the CDR activation to the rest of the body and the CNS.\nIf it is an immune cell, chronic CDR activation leads to immune exhaustion, making us unable to clear infections. There is a persistent, futile attempt at immune activation, resulting in never-ending, fruitless, mild inflammation that never fully resolves.\nIf a cold virus enters the body, we manage it with our existing immune resources in a semi-effective way—otherwise, we would be so immunosuppressed that we would not survive. However, we are unable to mount a fully efficient immune response like healthy individuals, so symptoms tend to be milder or even absent.\nI do suspect, however, that because of this, we accumulate more and more infections over time. Indeed, in ME/CFS, large reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, herpesviruses, fungi, and many others have been documented.\nWhen we push ourselves physically, due to inefficient OXPHOS at the mitochondria, we try to compensate by boosting glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, but this fails, leading to electron leakage and a localized increase in ROS formation. This eventually triggers a peak of mTOR activation, IFN-α production, extracellular ATP release, etc., pushing us into a transient CDR1 state. This further depletes mitochondrial oxidative capacity for several days. In my opinion, this is what underlies PEM.\nIt is evident that the CDR has been found both in the periphery and in the CNS, and that each greatly influences the other. The periphery sends signals through the vagus nerve and through soluble alarmins crossing the BBB, while the CNS sends signals to the periphery through different efferent nerves.\nHowever, remember that Suramin does not cross the BBB, yet it “cures” autism in mice and improves autism symptoms in autistic children. This is clear evidence that the periphery has a significant influence on the CNS.\nIs CDR universal?\nRegarding your second question, it is not entirely accurate. Strictly speaking, the term CDR was coined by Naviaux, referring to all the cellular processes that are triggered when a cell is exposed to any kind of stressor—whether microbiological, oxidative, reductive, toxic, ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation, etc.\nThis includes absolutely all the mechanisms that have already been studied and are well established in the scientific literature, although they were often considered separately. These include, for example, the integrated stress response, the chaperone response, autophagy, mitophagy, the increase in free radicals, the decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and the initial rise in glycolysis, the unfolded protein response, apoptosis, and so on.\nWhat Naviaux contributed was the realization that these processes always occur in a specific sequence, which he termed CDR1, then CDR2, and then CDR3. In other words, whenever cells enter this state due to stress, they will always begin with the first stage, and to exit the CDR they must progress through the same stages in order.\nNaviaux argues that the main perpetuating mechanism of the CDR is extracellular ATP and/or the sensitization of purinergic receptors on the cell membrane, which overreact to nearly normal levels of extracellular ATP. But if you take the time to study all these processes carefully, there are docens of activated pathways that are potentially therapeutically modifiable, and personally I am trying to compile which of them are the most important beyond the purinergic pathway.\nMoreover, Naviaux has realized that these states represent a universal process of all the body’s cells to try to overcome stress and achieve healing by returning to a state of cellular homeostasis.\nIt is very important to clarify that all the components and processes belonging to the CDR were already known and studied; they are not theoretical. Above all, the CDR always exists whenever there is a deviation from cellular homeostasis. In other words, wherever there is disease, there is CDR. Simply, in different diseases one or another CDR state predominates.\nAnother important point to clarify is that all cells enter the CDR if exposed to stress. However, I often refer specifically to the immune system because I believe it ultimately determines the state of disease. For example, macrophages, when activated, enter a CDR1 state—not necessarily just because there is a stressor, but because they are activated, and they harness all the machinery of CDR1 to fight infections. If the infection is not cleared and they remain activated for too long, they eventually move through the phases until they reach CDR3, where eventually they become exhausted.\nThis concept is difficult to grasp, but it is true. In other words, the same processes occur during the normal activation of the immune system as when any non-immune tissue cell in the body is exposed to different types of stress. This is very useful because by studying how a macrophage is activated, how it enters the state, and how it becomes exhausted, we can observe all the steps of the CDR and extrapolate them to all other cells.\nAll the cells of the body have been shown to enter CDR in response to any stressor—from the liver in hepatitis to glial cells in our disease and in any neurological disorder, or even in chronic infections such as HIV, as well as immune cells, endothelial cells, muscle cells, endocrine cells, etc. This is why the CDR involves the entire organism.\nIn other words, the CDR is not an isolated theory—it is a unified designation of cellular processes that occur in the body under different stressors, the consequence of which is always disease. The symptoms will depend on which tissues are most affected and in which CDR stage those cells predominantly reside.\nCDR reading list\nI’d start with this one first:\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22700427/\nAnd then read all the others, especially the one from 2014:\nwww.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567724913002390\nAnd the last one from 2023:\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120082/\nHowever, let me warn you about something. Keep in mind that Naviaux’s papers, especially the early ones, simply describe the CDR in a situation of acute stress. And even though he does cite CDR3, the diseases described there present a very pro-inflammatory profile, which is the complete opposite of what happens in our case.\nI believe it was starting with the ME/CFS paper that he noticed the metabolic parameters were reversed compared to what he had found in acute CDR. That is when he began to propose a hypometabolic type of CDR (CDR3A) which he only formally described in the most recent 2023 paper, where you can see it in the attached figure referred to as HSS (hypometabolic survival syndromes).\nOn the other hand, I should explain that unfortunately Naviaux does not focus on the immune system, but rather in cellular metabolism and mitochondria. That is why he focuses on metabolic pathways and says very little about the immune system. Nor does he go into describing known processes such as ISR, UPR, mitophagy, autophagy, etc. Instead, he mainly focuses on explaining the role of mitochondria in controlling, planning, and regulating all these metabolic processes, how the purinergic pathway is the main regulator of it all, and then elaborates on how the CDR is a repair mechanism orchestrated by the mitochondria, and so on.\nHowever, the angle from which he describes it and the focus he gives it is also very useful. It all begins with a lack of electrons at the cytoplasmic level, which is sensed by the mitochondrion as an oxidative signal, triggering its shutdown. As a consequence, the oxygen that should have been consumed and reduced at mitochondrial complex IV instead generates free radicals, both through the activity of NADPH oxidase and by reacting with electrons leaking from the mitochondria. All of this sets in motion an intracellular oxidative defense mechanism, an ancestral response inherited from bacteria.\nI spent a long time reflecting on what exactly he meant by “stealing electrons.” Of course, this refers to the fact that any stressor—whether free radicals, most toxins, or most infections—directly causes oxidative stress, which is what the mitochondrion actually senses. But this also includes the activation of all PRRs, since they likewise induce mechanisms that lead to oxidative stress. Similarly, when there is an infection and endoplasmic reticulum stress occurs, this is also perceived as a lack of electrons, or oxidative stress. In other words, it is a very simplified way of referring to a set of mechanisms that are in reality highly complex.\nIf you are looking for something related to the central nervous system and the CDR, the most direct work is the theoretical studies published by Naviaux on the relationship between autism and the CDR:\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29253638/\nBeyond that, if you want to read about the CDR in neurological diseases, you should look, for example, at UPR or ISR in Alzheimer’s, or explore the purinergic system in neuroglial activation, the purinergic system in Parkinson’s, or mTOR and mitochondria in the central nervous system, etc. In other words, you need to be creative and search for the parts of the CDR that interest you in the specific disease you want to study.\nFor example:\n“Glial Purinergic Signaling-Mediated Oxidative Stress (GPOS) in Neuropsychiatric Disorders”\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35281471/\nImmunosuppressed/infected protocol\nHey M,\nBased on the analysis I conducted for you, here is my opinion on the treatment you are considering.\nFirst of all, you have so many infections that I truly believe that tackling them one by one with their traditional treatments—antibiotics, specific antivirals, and antiparasitics—would be overwhelming, intolerable, highly toxic, and ultimately ineffective. This has been my experience, as well as my partner’s, after years of antibiotics, disulfiram, dapsone, intravenous antibiotics, etc.\nAdditionally, my experience with antipurinergic therapies and my partner’s experience after a year and a half on them—despite not seeing dramatic clinical improvements—has shown significant progress in lab results. NK cell counts have increased, and all Lyme tests we have taken have turned negative, something antibiotics failed to achieve even after many years. This tells me that the strategy of exiting the CDR is fundamental, but it must be done properly and in a coordinated manner.\nIn this regard, in my opinion, the primary pathways to start restoring immune function, in order, would be purinergic receptors. Here, we encounter a problem: the currently available inhibitors—lidocaine cream for P2X7 inhibition and pannexin-1 inhibitors such as Brilliant Blue FCF and Probenecid—are certainly very potent, but since they reach the central nervous system, they may be difficult to tolerate due to their significant reduction of synaptic activity. However, it is also possible that the real issue is that they activate the immune system so strongly that they cause severe fatigue and overall worsening.\nWithin the next 2-3 weeks or so, I believe that @m, my partner, and I, will be able to confirm this and assess whether suramin, which does not penetrate the central nervous system, is significantly better tolerated. If that turns out to be the case, I believe your best option would be to take suramin. If our test results are positive, we could (hopefully, if we can find a proper source) guide you on where to obtain it, how to test it, and how to use it, provided that you have the option to receive an intravenous infusion at home once a month.\nOn another note, I want to emphasize that inhibiting purinergic receptors is one of the most effective ways to restore overall immune function, halt CD8 lymphocyte depletion (as well as lymphocyte depletion in general), and reverse immune exhaustion.\nThe next approach, which I consider to be on par with the purinergic system, is GcMAF. This is because all studied pathogens to date, including HIV, influenza virus, herpesviruses, Borrelia, etc., produce nagalase, meaning they are capable of suppressing the immune system at the highest level—via macrophages. As you know, macrophages orchestrate both innate and adaptive immune responses and determine the appropriate course of action. Therefore, if you can find a genuine intravenous GcMAF, I would recommend taking it.\nRegarding the direct inhibition of pathogen proliferation—and following the same approach of inhibiting all pathogens simultaneously, as we do with suramin and GcMAF—JHU seems like a perfect strategy. This is because glutamine metabolism is essential for all types of pathogens. Additionally, it will help reduce neuroinflammation caused by glutamate and NH3 and indirectly inhibit the itaconate shunt, thereby improving mitochondrial function.\nI know you have developed a fear of inhibiting MTOR after having a very bad reaction. However, taking 0.1 mg of Everolimus daily should be well tolerated and could help overall in exiting the CDR and boosting the immune system.\nAs for RRX001, I have no idea how it will work, and in your case, I would wait to see how others respond to it first, as it might be excessively inflammatory for you. It could be a great drug, but I would approach it cautiously and observe its effects on others before trying it.\nI would not take disulfiram; it is far too aggressive neurologically and can cause permanent neurocognitive damage, as has happened to many people, including my partner. I assure you, it is no miracle cure, and it does not eradicate Lyme when the immune system is this suppressed. This has been my experience, my partner’s, and that of many others with severe ME/CFS.\nThe TGF-β inhibitor seems excellent, but I also anticipate that it will be too potent. I would recommend either waiting to see how others tolerate it or starting with very, very low doses.\nAlloferon, which functions similarly to Ampligen, could be ideal if you tolerate it. However, since it stimulates the innate immune response in a rather non-specific manner, it could also cause significant discomfort, so be cautious with it.\nRegarding Cordyceps, Saccharomyces boulardii, Bacillus subtilis, lumbrokinase, and the GAPS diet—especially if done in a ketogenic and carnivore-adjacent way—they should help significantly. It will reduce inflammation, improve gut permeability (leaky gut), improve mitochondrial efficiency, lower ROS production and possibly decrease intestinal ammonia translocation, which could be highly beneficial.\nA potentially less aggressive way to reduce TGF-β might be inhibiting AHR with TMS. The issue is that there are no human studies, so we are in uncharted territory. We will have to see how it affects us, but starting with the lowest possible dose used in studies, around 2 mg per day, could be an option to begin gradually restoring immune function. This is a central pathway in immune suppression as well IMO.\nI definitely recommend Sephin1. It does not appear to cause issues for those who have tried it, and some have reported rapid improvement. It should help activate general cellular repair mechanisms allowing the immune system to get properly activated while decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress, increasing antioxidant capacity, etc.\nRegarding mitochondrial biogenesis stimulation with TQS, I assume it would be well-tolerated. However, my opinion is that mitochondria should be capable of inducing their own biogenesis when necessary and at the right time. This typically follows proper activation of the ISR, UPR, and mitochondrial UPR, along with autophagy processes. Therefore, forcing mitochondrial biogenesis during immune suppression may not be the best approach, but this remains a theoretical consideration that we will need to evaluate.\nFinally, I believe you are right to avoid salicinium for now if it causes you discomfort. In my opinion (and I know this will be debated), inducing cellular apoptosis in an immunosuppressed system could trigger issues related to autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. It seems more appropriate to use it when the immune system is stronger or if you are able to tolerate it.\nAs for IMU, yes, it is an immunosuppressant, so I don’t think it’s the best strategy to boost your immune system. It is preferable to strengthen immune function so it can effectively clear chronic infections while simultaneously treating them with the strategies I mentioned above. If, as in your case, there is full lytic replication, using an antiviral seems appropriate.\nOn the other hand, I believe that inhibiting JAK1 may be essential and even necessary to tolerate the treatments. I consider two options here. The first is to boost the immune system with all the strategies mentioned above, and once it is strengthened, if you do not experience clear clinical improvement, then take Filgotinib. Alternatively, if you are unable to tolerate the treatments aimed at enhancing immune function, then take Filgotinib in very low or pulsed doses. This is something you should carefully consider. In my opinion, the itaconate shunt is fundamental for reversing immunosuppression and mitochondrial dysfunction.\nApologies for the length of this message, but I wanted to provide you with a thorough analysis of your treatment. I truly hope this serves as a useful guide to help refine your approach.\nI sincerely hope you find a way to tolerate treatments and achieve effective results!\n…\nAs for branched-chain amino acids that could feed into the TCA cycle, it’s tricky, since they could raise the NADH/NAD⁺ ratio again, which might be harmful — though it could be worth trying. Creatine, on the other hand, definitely shouldn’t be a problem, as it follows a different pathway used primarily for explosive muscular movements.\nBut in cases like yours, where you’ve improved yet are still very ill, I’d be more cautious. Increasing glycolytic flux could be problematic — for instance, using amino acid precursors or activating PDH with DCA. And too many antioxidants could worsen reductive stress, so I’m not sure about CoQ10, for example, or even acetyl-L-carnitine, since fatty acid oxidation might also increase reductive stress. So it’s really very person-dependent and depends on their current state.\nThat said, I myself reached a very good point thanks to GcMAF — I was going to the gym four times a week, driving, attending classes, etc. I was at 50–70% of my baseline, and yet mitochondrial supplements didn’t do anything for me. So I think that — even if you do benefit from mitochondrial-targeted therapies — boosting the immune system to clear the root causes of mitochondrial dysfunction is key.\nTCAP1\nI’ve studied the issue of reductive stress in the context of the TCAP-1 peptide, and here is a summary of the mechanism involved.\nUnder normal physiological conditions, when neurons fire, there is a transient influx of calcium into the cytoplasm. A portion of this calcium is taken up by mitochondria through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), which activates calcium-dependent dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle and enhances oxidative phosphorylation.\nHowever, under acute or sustained stress, particularly mediated by CRF, this system becomes dysregulated. Similar to what Wirth has described in muscle cells, CRF induces a significant rise in both cytosolic calcium and sodium. The elevated intracellular sodium promotes forward-mode activity of the mitochondrial Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCLX), leading to extrusion of calcium from the mitochondrial matrix. At the same time, CRF also triggers a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) through calcium-independent mechanisms—such as phosphorylation of respiratory complexes and rapid ROS generation. The combined effect is a reduction in mitochondrial calcium uptake via the MCU, which impairs activation of TCA cycle enzymes and leads to reduced oxidative phosphorylation.\nIn this state, CRF causes an accumulation of NADH due to reduced flux through the electron transport chain, accompanied by a drop in both ΔΨm and ATP production. This creates a biochemical profile consistent with reductive stress: high NADH, low NAD⁺, low ATP, and impaired electron transfer.\nThe addition of TCAP-1 reverses this process. It redirects calcium into the mitochondria—by restoring ΔΨm and facilitating Ca²⁺ entry through the MCU—and simultaneously reduces cytosolic calcium levels via enhanced extrusion. This dual effect restores mitochondrial function by reactivating the TCA cycle and enhancing the oxidation of NADH to NAD⁺, thus allowing electrons to properly enter the electron transport chain and generate ATP efficiently. As a result, TCAP-1 improves mitochondrial bioenergetics and resolves reductive stress.\nFurthermore, by reducing cytosolic calcium, TCAP-1 decreases CRF exocytosis. In brain regions such as the limbic system, and particularly in the dorsal raphe nucleus, this would result in reduced activation of CRF receptor 2 (CRF-R2). Lower CRF-R2 activity would in turn diminish the synthesis and release of serotonin from the raphe, reducing serotonergic drive to downstream limbic structures. This prevents desensitization of the serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT₁A), which is normally responsible for tonically inhibiting CRF-R2 expression. Preserving 5-HT₁A function therefore helps re-establish inhibitory control over CRF-R2 and reduces chronic serotonergic activation, which may play a key role in the limbic-driven inflammation seen in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.\nSo just to sum it up:\n\n\nChronic stress= CDR3A/ hypometabolism = low Mito calcium= immune exhaustion =low membrane potential =low ATP\n\n\nProper immune activation = CDR1= proper Immune activation = higher mito calcium= high membrane potential =high ATP\n\n\nToo much activation = too much Mito Calcium= low membrane potential =low ATP\n\n\nAnd then we go again to point 1.\nSo this peptide makes us go from 1 to 2\nFor neurons is kind of the same, but I think it is easier to visualize with immune cells\nI’ll answer more thoroughly regarding the details of this study, as it clearly illustrates how, at the early stages of the disease and/or in milder patients, there is a predominance of CDR1—characterized by high mitochondrial membrane potential, high GSH, and elevated mitochondrial calcium. As the disease progresses, however, immune activation can no longer be sustained, leading to a state of low-grade inflammation and predominant immune EXHAUSTION with potentially low Mito calcium\nI’ve been thoroughly reviewing the study, and here’s my interpretation. It’s crucial to remember that at the early stages of ME/CFS—or in milder cases—there is a greater inflammatory capacity. This means that a higher proportion of immune cells remain in a CDR1-dominant state, where elevated extracellular ATP leads to cytosolic calcium influx, which in turn increases mitochondrial calcium uptake. This rise in mitochondrial Ca²⁺ enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which initially triggers antioxidant response pathways such as the integrated stress response (ISR), along with activation of sirtuins and the NRF2 axis, promoting transcription of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione synthetase, superoxide dismutase, etc.\nIn this study, we see that female ME/CFS patients display a clearly more proinflammatory/CDR1-like profile, characterized by elevated ROS, increased proliferation of activated T cells, and higher mitochondrial calcium. Notably, they also exhibit greater antioxidant compensation, as reflected by elevated levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). In contrast, male patients show signs of a later-stage or exhausted response, with lower GSH, normalized mitochondrial calcium, and dampened ROS levels.\nOne particularly interesting finding is that early in the disease, there appears to be not only an increase in mitochondrial calcium but also a rise in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). In the supplementary material, when sexes are pooled, we observe a clear upward trend in both ΔΨm and mitochondrial biogenesis in ME/CFS—although not statistically significant. Unfortunately, due to the small sample size, sex-stratified analysis was not conducted. However, it seems likely that, had it been done, females would show higher ΔΨm and mitochondrial mass than controls, whereas males might show the opposite trend.\nIn my opinion, the data presented are not representative of long-term or severe ME/CFS, as most studies in those populations report decreased ΔΨm, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, and normalized GSH levels, often indistinguishable from healthy controls. That said, this study is highly informative from a progression standpoint—it likely captures a shift from CDR1 predominance to a more hypometabolic, CDR3a-like state in advanced disease.\nSeveral factors could explain these findings. First, the sample size is small, which limits statistical power. Second, as often happens, participants in clinical research tend to be moderately affected, thus skewing results toward a more proinflammatory profile. Third, the study finds a positive correlation between BMI and ROS levels, particularly in long COVID. Although not explored in depth here, it’s conceivable that female patients may have higher BMI early in disease due to immobility and estrogen-driven fat accumulation, which could independently amplify inflammation. Measuring insulin resistance in both sexes would have added valuable insight.\nAdditionally, high estrogen levels in females likely contribute to the proinflammatory skew, as estrogens are known to modulate antioxidant enzyme expression and T cell activation through ERα signaling.\nIn summary, treatments effective in proinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, lupus, or Alzheimer’s may not be effective in late-stage, hypometabolic ME/CFS with immunosuppression, but might be helpful in early or moderately inflamed patients. This distinction is critical when selecting therapies.\nIn my opinion, the data presented are not representative of long-term or severe ME/CFS, as most studies in those populations report decreased ΔΨm, reduced mitochondrial biogenesis, and normalized GSH levels, often indistinguishable from healthy controls\nAutoimmunity, IgG\nThe question you’re asking is central to the pathophysiology of ME/CFS and is also extremely complex. Below, I summarise some of the mechanisms by which antibodies from ME/CFS patients, forming immune complexes with a wide range of proteins, can affect mitochondria in healthy cells, as observed in many studies.\nUnfortunately, there does not appear to be a single autoantibody responsible for driving the CDR. It would be much simpler if that were the case. As you’ll see in the explanation below, there are many different antibodies bound to many types of proteins — microbial, self, inflammatory, complement-associated, etc. — which essentially indicates ongoing autoimmune processes that form part of the immunological memory perpetuating the CDR. This is why therapies such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or, in the future, experimental approaches that eliminate long-lived plasma cells make sense for targeting this immunological component of the self-perpetuating disease cycle.\nHowever, this humoral response must be put into context: it is not a primary driver. For example, it is plausible that nearly all people with ME/CFS harbour Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, or other unknown variants, even if we give them less attention than we should. Borrelia is known to induce the host to generate anti-collagen humoral responses in order to degrade collagen for its own benefit. This could account for part of what I’ve described above. Similarly, the persistence of Epstein–Barr virus in an abortive replication mode is an evolutionary strategy for pushing the host into a CDR, immunosuppressing them, and ensuring viral persistence. Secondarily, antibodies against viral particles form. In other words, the autoantibodies are secondary to the primary pathogenesis of ME/CFS.\nInterestingly, if autoantibodies played a dominant role in ME/CFS pathophysiology, we would expect most of us to respond positively to IVIG or immunoadsorption therapies. Yet this is not the case, except in studies involving less severely affected, more autoreactive individuals, who in my opinion have a stronger predominance of autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity than the very severe ME/CFS patients who are unable to participate in studies.\nFinally, to illustrate this hierarchy of importance: one of Prusty’s key findings was that fibronectin levels within immunoglobulin complexes were low, but fibronectin levels in plasma were high and capable of activating TLR4, driving the CDR, etc. This was linked to EBV or HHV-6 acting on B1 plasma cells in the bone marrow, reducing natural IgM levels. Interestingly, suramin has been shown to increase natural IgM and decrease fibronectin-1. This is a clear example of how such alterations are secondary to a CDR state — involving alarmins, cytokines, and persistent microbes — that perpetuates a hypometabolic state in which the humoral response also plays its role in maintaining this cycle.\nPossible mechanisms by which IgG/IgM immune complexes from ME/CFS or Long COVID can drive a CDR in otherwise healthy cells are as follows. These antibodies often circulate as immune complexes with host antigens—e.g., extracellular-matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin) or complement factors—and, in some reports, with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antigens as well. The dominant cargo seems to track clinical phenotype: in ME/CFS, complexes are relatively enriched for extracellular-matrix proteins, whereas in Long COVID they more often include coagulation-cascade proteins.\nFirst, pattern-recognition signaling can be triggered directly at the surface (e.g., fibronectin-containing complexes engaging TLR4 and integrins) or after FcγR/FcRn-mediated uptake of the immune complex. Internalized complexes can expose endosomal TLRs (TLR7/8/9) to nucleic-acid cargo and/or viral components—including EBV-antigen–bound IgGs—amplifying interferon programs, NF-κB/IRF activation, and a shift toward an antiviral, hypometabolic CDR.\nSecond, direct receptor modulation by Fab can occur when autoantibodies target cell-surface receptors such as GPCRs (e.g., β2-adrenergic, muscarinic M3/M4). Chronic agonism/antagonism skews cAMP/Ca²⁺/MAPK signaling that governs mitochondrial fusion–fission, promoting mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced OXPHOS, and lower ATP. These Fab-driven effects can synergize with Fc/FcγR/TLR/integrin signaling to stabilize the CDR state.\nTogether, these routes—PRR activation by ECM/viral-antigen–containing complexes, Fc-dependent internalization and endosomal sensing, and Fab-mediated receptor bias—converge on a shared outcome: a durable antiviral, pro-inflammatory, hypometabolic program that recapitulates key cellular features of ME/CFS or Long COVID.\nThus, although all of this may sound highly complex, if we widen the lens, it becomes less so. ME/CFS is potentially triggered by chronic infections that have managed to persist for a variety of reasons that, at some point, led to an immunosuppressed state — for example, heavy metal intoxication, exposure to mold, severe stress, and other insults. This hypometabolic CDR state is perpetuated both by the ongoing action of microbes and by what I call “sterile” vicious cycles, in which the immune system itself — both humoral and cellular — plays a central role. This includes  autoantibodies, memory B and T cells, among others.\nWe also have other sterile perpetuation circuits at the neuronal level, such as those involving the amygdala, hypothalamus, or other parts of the limbic system. This has been clearly demonstrated in mice: perfectly healthy animals, when the same neurons are activated that would be in infection-induced sickness behaviour, develop the illness phenotype without any pathogen present. Additionally, there is a form of sterile memory involving alarmins — extracellular ATP, interferon-alpha, succinate, fumarate, mitochondrial DNA, and so on. Lastly, we have persistent “memory” embedded in mitochondrial and cellular membranes, especially in lipid rafts, which tend to lock the cell into an antiviral, CDR-like state.\nHowever, all of this can be corrected. Primarily, we must remove the main source of these alarmins and the proteins that will later become autoantibody targets — in other words, chronically infected cells. Then, we must enable uninfected, otherwise healthy cells to exit the CDR state — both naturally, as alarmin and inflammation levels fall, and through targeted therapies, such as anti-purinergics, mTOR inhibitors… , which can actively promote exit from that state. In parallel, we must strengthen the immune system and block sterile infection circuits by using different strategies: modulating the limbic system, improving membrane lipid composition, depleting long-lived plasma cells, and immunosuppressing with agents such as filgotinib or analogous drugs to reduce chronic inflammation and also break the itaconate cycle.\nImmediate vs progressive sickness\nYou’re absolutely right. I also became ill within the span of an hour — I went to take a nap feeling fine and woke up with severe CFS.\nIn the early phase, there’s a predominance of a pro-inflammatory CDR1, and the very same mechanisms that sustain this state are the ones that eventually drive you into immunosuppression and perpetuate the disease.\nYou weren’t immunodepressed from the very beginning, but there was likely a dual situation in which parts of your immune system were already weakened — for example, due to dental amalgams, mold exposure, root canals, or long-term sustained stress, etc. — which allowed certain infections to gain ground. These could have been chronic, like Epstein–Barr virus, or acute, like COVID in recent years.\nIn such a scenario, your already somewhat compromised immune system was unable to clear the infection. The adaptive strategies of the pathogen took hold and, little by little, in order to ensure its own persistence, pushed you into a CDR state with chronic inflammation that inevitably causes symptoms.\nAt first, you’re in a pro-inflammatory state, but one that’s relatively ineffective; over the years, this shifts into an immunosuppressed state — unable to mount robust responses to stimuli, yet marked by a low-grade, chronic inflammatory tone.\nAnd this inherent inflammation causes the symtoms, from the very beginning…\nHey [x]  again. There’s something you asked that I didn’t answer, and I think it’s important. When you say you became ill in a single day and point out that you can’t become immunosuppressed in a day, the thing is — it doesn’t work quite like that. You can have the illness developing silently over many years, but there’s often a moment when the inflammatory and defensive signals reaching the brain switch the system from a healthy homeostasis to a sickness homeostasis. That switch is essentially a brain-mediated decision and can occur within minutes.\nFor example, my partner has experienced several episodes where, after receiving homeopathic doses of multiple Borrelia, Babesia, and Bartonella strains together, she went from being bedridden to, within an hour, getting up, her face visibly changing, all signs of inflammation diminishing, and being able to go out shopping. When I was in a more moderate state and took amphetamines to get through hospital training shifts, I felt perfectly healthy during those eight hours. The same has happened with LDI to me, and the first time I took D-ribose I had ten consecutive days of complete remission, literally from one day to the next.\nWhat I mean is that, regardless of your immune or inflammatory status, there’s also a central nervous system interpretation of the systemic “safety” context that can shift within seconds. This is why it’s possible to become acutely ill within hours — but that momentary switch does not reflect the full underlying evolution of what’s been happening in the background for years.\nSimilarly, recovery from the illness often follows the same pattern, as noted for example by Dr. Sarah Myhill. You can spend years doing everything right — detoxifying, strengthening the immune system, taking antimicrobials, improving diet, treating leaky gut and fermenting gut, and so on — with little noticeable improvement. Then, suddenly, within days, you start to get better. It’s as if there’s a threshold that must be crossed, which you may not perceive clinically while it’s happening. But once you pass it, the improvement becomes apparent very quickly.\nDifference between other chronic infections?\n\nYou mention HIV, which is a chronic infection and presumably CDR would not be shut off and in fact progress to CDR3, since HIV is one of the most immune suppressive infections there is. How come that (to my knowledge, at least) most HIV patients don’t have PEM? Is the body’s reaction (ie what symptoms it will produce) in face of CDR then determined by genetics?\n\nThat’s a very good question, and I don’t really have a definitive answer, but I can hypothesize.\nNaviaux proposes that infectious diseases, autoimmune conditions, and some forms of autism belong to the CDR3 category, which represents chronic CDR. But in his most recent work (2023), he realized he needed to create a new category for hypometabolic or fatiguing illnesses—those that cause ME/CFS after infection, whether it’s Long COVID, Epstein-Barr virus, tick-borne diseases, and so on.\nIt’s interesting that all chronic infections like HIV, hepatitis, or tuberculosis are accompanied by significant fatigue. And there are studies showing that some of these patients can go on to develop ME/CFS. For example, here is a study showing that tuberculosis patients are more likely to develop ME/CFS:\npubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35189895/\nSimilarly, patients with hepatitis undergoing interferon treatment have also been shown to develop ME/CFS, although I assume in this case it is because the interferon-α/JAK1/itaconate cycle is triggered.\nClearly the same applies to COVID, even though it is not a chronic infection, and the same has been observed with Coxsackie or Epstein-Barr infections—where after some months you may either recover or develop ME/CFS.\nWhat remains unclear to me is why, as you point out, people with diseases like HIV or hepatitis suffer from a lot of fatigue, but sometimes benefit from moderate exercise. Although intense exercise has been shown to worsen their fatigue, it does not cause the delayed worsening at 48 hours that we see in ME/CFS.\nIt is as if they retain a greater functional reserve than we do: their mitochondria are able to respond to exertion, perhaps by increasing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation despite a rise in free radicals, and possibly also by boosting anaerobic ATP production in the cytoplasm. In contrast, we lack that functional reserve. My intuition is that in these conditions, fatigue is caused mainly by inflammatory cytokines, not by the same mechanism as in ME/CFS, where the picture is more consistent with sickness behavior at the level of the central nervous system (particularly the limbic system), and with an exhausted CDR3A—hypersensitized to everything that signals danger, whether it’s extracellular ATP, interferon-α, succinate, cardiolipin, reactive oxygen species, LPS, and so on.\nPerhaps one piece of evidence for this, at least in my own case, is that when I was in a more moderate state and taking methylphenidate to be able to attend classes and hospital rotations, I always found it remarkable that taking high doses of these stimulants for eight hours did not cause PEM. Yet in the same state, without stimulants but forcing myself to do things, I did experience PEM. I believe these stimulants, by increasing dopamine, temporarily reduced the sickness behavior of the central nervous system and prevented the onset of PEM. This has always struck me and is something I have thought about for a long time.\nIf you think about it carefully, there is a fundamental difference between chronic infections and ME/CFS. Chronic infections, if untreated, can be fatal—HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis. ME/CFS, on the other hand, drives the body into a hypometabolic state and a CDR. At the cellular level, this allows cells to upregulate their antiviral and antimicrobial defenses dramatically, which is the very function of the CDR: it protects cells from dying  from these infections, but at the cost of chronic systemic symptoms.\nAs an example, there are people with Borrelia burgdorferi infection who die without developing ME/CFS but instead present with severe neurological, muscular, vascular autoimmune manifestations—highly inflammatory and sometimes lethal. By contrast, people with ME/CFS and Borrelia infection (the majority in my experience) enter that hibernation-like state, where reduced inflammation, paradoxically, seems to protect us.\nIFN gamma\nIFN-γ (interferon gamma) is the key cytokine in the adaptive TH1-type immune response. When a macrophage detects a bacterial or viral antigen via TLR activation, it produces and releases IL-12, which then stimulates both NK cells and CD8⁺ T cells. These cells, in turn, produce and release IFN-γ, which further activates the macrophage. This loop helps promote a proper TH1 (and sometimes TH17) response, enhances MHC-I and MHC-II expression, and primes the immune system for pathogen clearance.\nHowever, this adaptive response takes 4–5 days to fully develop in response to a new antigen. In the meantime, TLR activation triggers an immediate innate response via NF-κB and the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I), mainly IFN-α and IFN-β.\nIn the early hours, IFN-α is central to launching the innate antiviral program, primarily through the induction of ISGs (interferon-stimulated genes). These include:\nPKR: Activates the ISR (Integrated Stress Response) by phosphorylating eIF2α, thereby suppressing viral (and host) protein synthesis.\nOAS/RNase L: Destroys viral RNA.\nOther ISGs that encode various antimicrobial proteins.\nAt this point, cells enter an acute CDR1 metabolic state, prioritizing defense over growth and protein synthesis.\nOne particularly important ISG is IRG1 (also known as ACOD1), which drives itaconate production. Itaconate disrupts the TCA cycle, creating a low-energy, antimicrobial metabolic state. It also has direct antiviral and pro-inflammatory effects in early infection and amplifies its own pathway by upregulating IFN-α, which induces more IRG1, generating a positive feedback loop.\nAs days pass, signals driven by IFN-α also support the priming of the adaptive immune system, promoting activation of CD4⁺ T cells, CD8⁺ T cells, and B cells, which differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibodies. At this stage, in intracellular infections, inflammation becomes dominated by IFN-γ.\nWhat I’ve described so far reflects what happens in acute infection. But in our case — dealing with chronic infections and immune dysfunction — the scenario changes.\nIf these inflammatory loops were not self-limiting, they would be lethal. Indeed, in early COVID-19 strains, patients with metabolic or immune compromise (e.g., insulin resistance) often experienced fatal hyperinflammation. It is well described that chronic elevation of IFN-γ leads to immune downregulation. Similarly, prolonged IFN-α signaling — especially through sustained itaconate production — leads to strong immunosuppression.\nThis makes sense: once a pathogen is cleared, the immune system needs to shut down the response. But the problem arises when pathogen persistence causes these defense pathways to remain chronically active, leading to ongoing immune exhaustion.\nOver time, hyperactivation of immune cells leads to energetic collapse: both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) decline. As a result, protein synthesis drops, including synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines like IFN-γ, which explains why IFN-γ levels are low in chronic fatigue or immune exhaustion states.\nHowever, mitochondrial failure leads to the release of mtDNA, which activates the cGAS-STING pathway, inducing type I interferons (including IFN-α). Simultaneously:\nmTOR is activated by mitochondrial stress and further promotes IFN-α production.\nPurinergic receptors, which are activated in both acute danger and cellular exhaustion, also upregulate IFN-α.\nItaconate itself contributes to IFN-α induction.\nSo although IFN-α is essential in early immune activation, in chronic infections such as ME/CFS, tuberculosis, HIV, or late-stage sepsis, elevated IFN-α becomes a driver of sustained immune suppression and exhaustion.\nThus, in chronic infections with an exhausted immune system, we often observe reduced IFN-γ alongside persistently elevated IFN-α — or at least in specific dysfunctional immune cell subsets.\nIs IFNa always bad for us?\nIt is context dependent. Let me share a compilation of studies about this subject. We definitely fall under the second context IMO unless we are in the early phase of the disease:\nType I interferons, especially IFN-α, can act as both immune stimulants and suppressors depending on dosage, context, and exposure duration. In early HIV infection or controlled administration, IFN-α can enhance CD8+ T cell activation, as seen in Manion et al. (2012). However, in chronic exposure or advanced disease, high levels of IFN-α promote immunosuppression through IL-10 induction, PD-L1 expression, and lymphocyte apoptosis. This biphasic behavior reflects a priming effect at low doses and receptor saturation or desensitization at high doses, contributing to immune exhaustion in chronic infections.\nSources:\nIFN I tolerance\nLTB4 signalling via the BLT1 receptor enhances the activation of the type I IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which leads to IFN-α production by interstitial macrophages to suppress in situ IMM proliferation.\ninflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (IMM)\nscholar.google.es/scholar%2C5&amp;q=Interferon+alpha+macrophages+tolerance+&amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1729504944827&amp;u=%23p%3D2TARVWzIm2MJ\nIFNa índice immune-suppression i. HIV Patients\nPersistently high levels of IP-10, and particularly IFN-α, are associated with lack of immunological response as reflected by CD4+ cell increase. Notably, a lack of decline or even a rise in these cytokines was an early indicator of immunological treatment failure, and as for IFN-α, even high baseline levels appear to predict such treatment failure. Furthermore, our finding of a marked suppressive effect of IFN-α on PHA-induced PBMC proliferation, even in concentrations comparable to circulating levels in HIV-infected patients, suggests that the association between immunological treatment failure and persistently high IFN-α levels are not only parallel phenomena, but rather reflect an important immunopathogenic role of IFN-α associated with impaired numerical and functional restoration of CD4+ T cells during HAART.\n(…) Mechanisms for the suppressive effect of IFN-α on lymphocyte proliferation are therefore unclear, but may involve factors such as enhanced production of cytokines with anti-proliferative effects (e.g. IL-10).\n(…) Whatever the mechanisms, our findings, in addition to the recent demonstration of inhibitory effects of IFN-α on production of chemokines [17] and IL-12 [38], suggest a role for IFN-α in HIV-related disease and immunodeficiency.\nacademic.oup.com/cei/article-abstract/119/3/479/6461865\nLow doses cause immune stimulation and high doses immune-suppression\nThey referred to this hyperresponsiveness of IFN-pretreated cells as “priming.” Lockhart (61) subsequently reported that pretreatment of cells with low concentrations of IFN enhanced their ability to secrete IFN when subsequently induced, whereas pretreatment with higher concentrations of IFN inhibited their ability to synthesize IFN. This phenomenon of low-dose priming and high-dose blocking has been described in numerous IFN induction systems (reviewed by Stewart (62)). Although this phenomenon has not been fully explained, one likely possibility is that low-dose IFN primes for an enhanced response by upregulation of IFN receptors on the cell surface, whereas higher doses would saturate surface receptors and downregulate subsequent responses to secondary induction.\nCentral to the argument that an orally administered low dose of IFN-α is a priming signal for immune response via interactions with IFN-α receptors on the immune system is the observation by Havell and Spital (29) that pretreatment of murine Mf with low doses of IFN-α/β (1–10 IU) markedly enhanced their IFN-α/β responses to endotoxin. In contrast, pretreatment of Mf with 100–1,000 IU of IFN-α/β markedly suppressed their subsequent response to endotoxin. These authors demonstrated a similar low-dose priming, high-dose blocking of Mf responses with IFN-γ pretreatment. The concentrations of IFN-α/β generating the Mf priming responses are remarkably similar to the concentrations of orally administered IFN.\nwww.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/107999099313325\nIFNa increases CD8 and lowers HIV\nscholar.google.es/scholar%2C5&amp;q=Exogenous+Interferon+alfa+HIV+&amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1729506811116&amp;u=%23p%3Dci2im8eJNhgJ\nInduction of immunosuppression\nThe clinical corollary is the immunosuppression of uninfected T cells and the decline in C-C chemokine release found at advanced stages of HIV-1 infection paralleling rising levels of IFN-α and extracellular Tat.\nscholar.google.es/scholar%2C5&amp;q=Exogenous+Interferon+alfa+HIV+immune+anergy+&amp;btnG=#d=gs_qabs&amp;t=1729507006427&amp;u=%23p%3DOdH8xL3fhboJ\nHIV-1 disease progression is associated with depletion of human leukocytes including human CD4+ T cells.\nAlthough several reports show that persistent ISG induction is correlated with disease progression in HIV-1–infected patients (…)\nStudy: We found that IFNAR1 blockade rescued both the number and function of human T cells, and prevented HIV-1–induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis, in spite of higher levels of virus replication. Thus, sustained IFN-I signaling plays a major role in CD4+ T cell depletion during persistent HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, we found that IFNAR1 blockade increased the expression of activation markers CD38/HLA-DR and Ki-67 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and was positively correlated with HIV-1 viremia.\n(…) IFN-Is are critical to the death of human T cells during chronic HIV-1 infection.\n(…) Blocking IFN-I signaling with an anti-IFNAR1 mAb can enhance antiviral immune responses and prevent or accelerate clearance of persistent LCMV infection in mice (16, 17).\nSo in mild patient’s still in a very inflammatory state, you could still promote a proper innate and adquiered Th1 response. But over time as the immune exhaustion progresses and get chronic, the chances are you’ll be making the problem worse\nFibrosis and CDR2\nYeah, that’s correct! Fibrotic diseases, generally framed within CDR2, do indeed have severe oxygen diffusion problems. This is because fibrosis increases the distance between the capillary and the cell, so no matter how much oxygen is present in the capillary, it simply doesn’t reach the cells effectively.\nHowever, we are not at that stage. We don’t have such extensive sclerotic tissue as seen in those conditions that would prevent oxygen from reaching the cells. Perhaps in older individuals, where ME/CFS coexists with other comorbidities, this could be an issue, and these people might benefit from supplemental oxygen. But in 20-40 years-old with severe ME/CFS, this level of fibrosis is not present. Their venous and arterial oxygen levels are high, and CO₂ levels are low. This suggests that oxygen is not being properly utilized by the mitochondria in my opinion.\nOtherwise, supplemental O2 and HBOT would be beneficial for many of us, and it is not for most.\nCalcium and sodium\nExactly, this is what I was referring to, which is what Naviaux mentions in his study.\nIn any case, independently of the lipid-mediated memory formed between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, the key focus, in my opinion, should be on interrupting the signaling pathways that lead to elevated cytosolic calcium, which are not limited to P2Y receptors. While P2Y receptors primarily mobilize intracellular calcium through IP3-mediated release from the ER, P2X receptors, including P2X7, directly allow extracellular calcium influx.\nAdditionally, the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), which typically exports calcium in exchange for sodium, can reverse its function under conditions of elevated intracellular sodium—such as impaired Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity due to ATP depletion and oxidative stress. This reversal leads to calcium influx, exacerbating cytosolic calcium overload.\nFurthermore, the endoplasmic reticulum stress increases CHOP which activates ERO1α, which in turn  increases ROS production during protein folding by promoting disulfide bond formation. Elevated ROS levels stimulate calcium release from the ER via IP3 receptors, signaling mitochondria and triggering the production of mitochondrial-derived danger-associated molecular patterns.\nMoreover, there are other pathways, including free radicals, mTOR, NF-κB, TGFb, that also stimulate calcium entry into the cytoplasm and the calcium flow from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria.\nThis is why, in my opinion, it is crucial to inhibit purinergic receptors and all other metabolic pathways that lead to this process in the first place.\n\nWell, it starts with high cytoplasmic calcium, as far as I know.\nSo, and this is something I am working on, I think that in CDR1 there is high calcium in the mitochondria, but in CDR3b, there is low calcium.\nIn fact, this happens in senescent cells, which are in CDR2 but have high NADH, like in CFS, so I’d say the same occurs in CFS.\nActually, Wirth’s theory kind of describes this dual scenario. Here is something I wrote about it you might find interesting:\n(the high sodium starts due to low ATP, ROS and excess adrenergic signal at the NA-K ATPasa)\nThe excess of sodium reverses NCX (normally imports sodium and exports calcium), so now sodium is released and calcium is imported\nin this scenario, intracellular K+ is lost: In ME/CFS, intracellular potassium decreases due to two mechanisms: impaired Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity and prolonged opening of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. The Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase cannot effectively reintroduce potassium into the cell due to low ATP and oxidative stress, while the KATP channels open under ATP depletion, allowing excessive potassium efflux. This potassium loss weakens the potassium gradient, reducing the cell’s ability to maintain a negative resting membrane potential. As a result, the membrane depolarizes, making it easier to activate voltage-dependent calcium channels, increasing calcium influx, which exacerbates muscle dysfunction, cramps, and energy imbalance.\n** we can differentiate this scenario at rest and after exercise in CFS:\nAt rest in ME/CFS, intracellular sodium levels are slightly elevated but not high enough to reverse the NCX (sodium-calcium exchanger) on the sarcolemma. This moderate sodium elevation reduces the efficiency of the NCX, making it less effective at exporting calcium from the cytoplasm, though it does not reverse its direction. Meanwhile, the elevated sodium enhances the activity of the mitochondrial NCLX, which uses the sodium gradient to export calcium from the mitochondria. This potentially leads to reduced mitochondrial calcium levels, impairing ATP production since calcium is crucial for activating key enzymes in the Krebs cycle. Additionally, the mild cytoplasmic calcium elevation, combined with reduced mitochondrial calcium, promotes a shift toward glycolysis even at rest, contributing to excessive lactate production and fatigue.\nWE DON’T REALLY KNOW IT CALCIUM IS LOW IN THE MITOCHONDRIA AT REST.\nDuring exercise, cytoplasmic sodium levels rise significantly, surpassing the threshold to reverse the NCX on the sarcolemma. This reversal causes a sudden influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, sharply elevating cytoplasmic calcium levels. The excess calcium enters the mitochondria through the MCU (mitochondrial calcium uniporter) and VDAC1 (voltage-dependent anion channel). Simultaneously, the rapid calcium influx depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane, slowing down the NCLX (This is from a above study) , which further reduces calcium export from the mitochondria. At this stage, mitochondrial calcium overload occurs because the combined effects of reduced calcium export via the NCLX and excessive calcium influx overwhelm the mitochondria’s regulatory capacity. The calcium-ATPase on the sarcolemma, which uses ATP to export calcium, has limited transport capacity and cannot keep pace with the rapid calcium influx during exercise. This explains why mitochondrial calcium might become deficient at rest but shifts to dangerous overload during exertion, contributing to oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction characteristic of PEM.\nSure, this is the same issue I see in the group with many other drugs: we look for treatments to reduce inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in a generic way, and these treatments are usually used for more inflammatory autoimmune diseases or even CDR3A or highly pro-inflammatory states in CDR1. Of course, in highly pro-inflammatory diseases, mitochondrial calcium is likely to be consistently elevated, making it beneficial. Whereas in ME/CFS, that might not be the case. I’m not certain, though, as I spent several days searching for studies on mitochondrial calcium levels in exhausted immune cells, which are characteristic of what happens to us systemically, and there are no measurements available anywhere.\nIt’s somewhat similar to what happens with mitochondrial uncouplers, which lower the membrane potential. In pro-inflammatory diseases where there’s high NAD+, and a drop in NADH, resulting in excessive oxidative stress in the mitochondria and membrane hyperpolarization, this works very well. Meanwhile, further depolarizing the membrane in an exhausted immune cell—as ocurrs in CFS—would only deplete it more.\nThis is further complicated by the fact that in ME/CFS, when we exert ourselves and enter PEM, we do transiently shift to CDR1, at least in some immune cells. Therefore, these types of therapies might help eliminate excess CDR1. Since immune exhaustion is often due to an initial excess of CDR1, they might gradually reduce the number of cells entering exhaustion, so it’s not entirely black and white, of course.\nSingle-receptor interventions vs general homeostasis-promoting interventinos\nThe only thing is that, in my view, it is preferable to stimulate the immune system by inhibiting or activating those CDR pathways that infections alter to immunosuppress us, since these are usually better tolerated therapies, such as inhibiting mTOR (although not always well tolerated by everyone), using antipurinergics, taking GcMAF, inhibiting glutamine with JHU-083, inhibiting AHR with TMS, inhibiting ACOD1/itaconate, etc. I believe these pathways are highly effective at stimulating the immune system and with fewer side effects and they stimulate the immune response in a physiological way.\nProblem is that with a single receptor or through only one pathway, you end up overstimulating one part while the rest of the immune system remains exhausted.\n\nThat’s a good point, I’ve been thinking about the exact same thing this week actually, but in more general terms. That is, even if we identify all the key bottlenecks in a system, how can we ensure that we apply the right ratio of inputs at each point so that we achieve the optimal homeostasis and don’t just push the system into another undesired state, due to some unintended asymmetry? This is actually a rather difficult problem in large-scale distributed systems, which biology more or less is, so the analogy strikes me as pertinent.\n\nI completely agree with you, and in fact that’s why, although my starting point is always individual mechanisms and how they connect with each other, when it comes to deciding whether a treatment is the right one or not, I prefer to look at the final outcome in an in vivo model—especially of chronic infection if such a model exists, and if not, of cancer, since cancer cells and infected cells are quite similar and so are their immunological profiles, though with some nuances.\nTherefore, now that we are talking about MENK, when you investigate the mechanisms through which it works, they are multiple and encompass a large part of those pathways that perpetuate the state of immunosuppression. Specifically, it acts through three receptors simultaneously, decreasing the excessive entry of Ca²⁺ into the cell and into the mitochondria, reducing the IL-6 → ↓STAT3/HIF-1α axis directly, and indirectly reducing mTOR and GSK3β. This leads to a global reduction of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress. In other words, it acts at many different levels and enhances all branches of the immune system in vivo, without increasing harmful and useless inflammation (TNFα, complement, TH17, etc.).\nAnother example: if you study basic immunology, you realize that everything starts with professional antigen-presenting cells, mainly dendritic cells and macrophages. Thus, it is not surprising that all microbes studied so far are capable of releasing an enzyme called nagalase, which breaks down the molecule that activates these two cells in the body, called GcMAF. Therefore, when you administer exogenous GcMAF, you are bypassing this inhibition and thereby activating the immune system from the top down—both the innate and the adaptive response. Absolutely all the pathways required for proper immune activation.\nThus, it is the studies that must demonstrate that the response is global, balanced, and without triggering a cytokine cascade that could be harmful.\nGcMAF\nThe best results I have seen, by far, come from GcMAF, which improves roughly 70% of ME/CFS patients by about 50–70%—a remarkably high response rate. So this pathway appears to be truly fundamental. However When I reached a 70% functionality with GcMAF I was not fully recovered, so something was missing\nGenetics &amp; HLA\nThat said, most of us were perfectly healthy well into our 20s, 30s, or even 40s. So while genetic susceptibility certainly plays a role, it does not negate the fact that we were able to live in the world, exposed to diverse infections, while maintaining a robust and balanced immune system. The problem seems to arise when cumulative circumstances—primarily infections and toxins—overwhelm immune capacity. Perhaps our “exhaustion threshold” is simply lower than in others who are predisposed instead to autoimmunity or different pathologies.\nAs you know, the central focus of my research is exactly this: identifying the mechanisms by which immune cells become exhausted. And there is much more to it than persistent antigens. Immunologically, cells can be driven into exhaustion by extracellular ATP overload, chronic IFN-α exposure, excess ROS, ER stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction by\nmetabolites originating from gut dysbiosis and fermentation (D-lactate, ammonia, alcohols, etc.). And there are many more examples: Nearly all studied microbes produce nagalase, directly inhibiting macrophage activation. Most pathogens in some way manipulate purinergic signaling: either by increasing extracellular adenosine (immunosuppressive), driving ATP release into the extracellular space (which eventually suppresses immunity), inducing chronic ISR activation with CHOP upregulation, or conversely inhibiting ISR to blunt host repair defenses, or upregulating mTOR to suppress mitochondria and immune function, or inhibit autophagy to impare proper antigen presentation and induce mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, most microbes studied have shown to inhibit VDR in order to impare the secretion of natural antimicrobial and shut down a big part of our innate response. So microbes have developed an extensive array of such strategies to directly induce immunosuppression.\nThe mechanism described in the paper—where low-affinity antibodies, macrophages, and chronic antigen presentation to T cells drive sustained IFN-γ release and macrophage activation—may indeed be part of the broader CDR-related immunosuppressive cycle, but probably mainly in patients with a strongly proinflammatory profile. In fact, in most long-term severe ME/CFS patients I see, IFN-γ is low (though not in all cases). For example, this study shows IFN-γ elevated early on, but falling below control levels over time:\n10.1126/sciadv.1400121\nHLA\nAnd I fully agree with you: it is obviously not all genetics. Otherwise, I would not have lived 22 years perfectly healthy, nor would my mother —she also suffers from ME/CFS—have lived 55 years perfectly healthy, etc. The issue is more likely an accumulation of toxic exposures, deficiencies in essential nutrients, non-ionizing EMF exposure at both low and high frequencies, pesticide exposure, heavy metals from amalgams, deodorants, vaccines, fish, etc., repeated antigenic stimulation from vaccines, and a microbial burden that eventually overwhelms the system. And indeed, those who develop autoimmune diseases tend to have HLAs that are better equipped to recognize antigens, which makes them overly efficient and prone to overshooting the response, so to speak. In contrast, in people like us, our less efficient HLA types predispose us to a higher likelihood of entering this state of chronic infections. But I am convinced we can return to the state we once had when we were healthy, where the immune system was competent.\nAutism via RNA\nI would also emphasize that immunosuppression can be perpetuated even in the absence of actual antigens. Likely both scenarios coexist. As Naviaux showed, injecting RNA into a pregnant mouse induced autism across all offspring without any infectious component. Many viral infections in ME/CFS are abortive: they generate short RNA fragments that are generally not presented to antigen-presenting cells, yet they still chronically activate PRRs, driving NF-κB, NLRP, and IFNI signaling—each of which alone can induce immune exhaustion. In these cases, no viral protein is produced that could even be presented to T cells.\nTCR is the root trigger\nTo complete the explanation, I should add that all the molecular mechanisms I described above—including extracellular ATP release and purinergic receptor activation, mTOR upregulation, increased ER stress, the initial activation and subsequent exhaustion of the ISR, activation of both the mitochondrial UPR and the ER UPR, IFN-α synthesis leading to later immunosuppression, and so on—are all downstream of TCR activation. In other words, these mechanisms all stem from continuous cellular activation. They are not merely a collection of independent processes that can also exhaust the cell; every single one originates from the initial activation of a T cell through its TCR upon binding a peptide presented by an antigen-presenting cell. This is a very important point to keep in mind.\nThis is very important, because when you target one of these downstream pathways of the TCR, you are in fact reducing the signal at the TCR itself and therefore diminishing chronic antigenic stimulation, while at the same time allowing proper activation of the immune cell.\nAHR\nin autoimmune diseases the opposite occurs compared to ME/CFS, cancer, and other hypometabolic or chronic infection states. That is, AHR activity is often reduced, and stimulation is usually beneficial, whereas inhibition can be detrimental.\nThe key lies in the purpose of the AHR: to down-regulate the immune system and restrain excessive pro-inflammatory responses. This can occur either due to xenobiotics entering the body (many of which activate AHR as a compensatory mechanism) or because the immune system is overly activated. This mechanism is highly useful in acute infections, since it is part of the CDR machinery: IDO expression increases, kynurenine (Kyn) rises, AHR is activated, and this serves as a brake.\nTherefore, you are right that this is context-dependent. What happens in ME/CFS and in cancer? Undoubtedly, AHR is overactivated. Why? Because IDO is overexpressed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines and also following PRR activation (e.g., TLRs by LPS, viral/bacterial RNA or DNA, etc.). Thus, in chronic infections and inflammation, IDO expression converts Trp into Kyn, the Trp/Kyn ratio decreases, and Kyn overactivates AHR. This is one of the main immunosuppressive pathways, as it raises Tregs, inhibits Teffs, and increases TGF-β.\nIn this context, you need to restore immunity to fight either cancer or infection. The fear of overshooting and causing autoimmunity, in my opinion, is not supported by the evidence. In animal studies where the immune system is boosted by AHR inhibition, the results show clinical benefit without excessive inflammation or autoimmunity.\nMoreover, it is not easy to induce autoimmunity when raising a suppressed immune system. For that, specific antigens need to be presented to APCs in the context of autoimmune disease, which is not occurring in us or in cancer. You would also need to cross the threshold from immunosuppression to an already overactivated immune system — but if you reached that point, you would most likely have already cured ME/CFS or cancer before triggering autoimmunity. Therefore, I truly believe the evidence does not support the idea that inhibiting AHR in cases of immunosuppression would promote autoimmunity.\nRegarding Trp and Kyn levels in ME/CFS, it depends on where you look. In the only Long COVID study that measured PBMCs, the result is clear: Trp tends to be low and Kyn high. The same has been shown in ME/CFS.\nIn blood, this is harder to detect, as the signal is diluted. Here you must look at the ratio: you may find normal Trp with high Kyn, or normal Kyn with low Trp, but in cancer, ME/CFS, and Long COVID you generally find low Trp and high Kyn — at least in terms of ratio, especially at the intracellular level and in PBMCs, which is where it matters.\nI do not rule out that in the very early stages of the disease, when the immune system is highly pro-inflammatory, with low TGF-β and Tregs, and still competent Th1 responses, inhibiting AHR might not be appropriate since full immunosuppression is not yet established. But in our cases, in the majority of cases, with evident immunosuppression, clear CD8 and NK cytotoxicity defects, elevated immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), a dominant Th2 profile (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), and weak Th1 responses (low IFN-γ, IL-12, etc.), I think it is evident that inhibiting AHR is beneficial.\nIt is much more intelligent to inhibit AHR than to inhibit IDO2. The point is that AHR is not only activated by Kyn, which is formed from Trp catabolism by IDO, but also by many other endogenous ligands. Therefore, you are addressing the problem much more broadly. Moreover, what perpetuates the continuous conversion of Trp into Kyn is IDO itself, which in this context is mainly expressed through AHR activation. Thus, by inhibiting AHR you can break this vicious cycle.\nALT-803/Anktiva\nSpecifically, for example, ALT-803 seems absolutely brutal to me. It has effects that I doubt most patients could tolerate, even at low doses. And honestly, I have read all the available trials, and the results are not as impressive as you would expect.\nBCG vaccine\nAs for Soquelitinib, I’ve read less about it, but I remember going through several studies, and it seems very interesting and with fewer side effects. Problem is that with a single receptor or through only one pathway, you end up overstimulating one part while the rest of the immune system remains exhausted. And that can lead to problems of inefficacy or autoimmunity, etc.\nAs for the BCG vaccine, I hold a different opinion. What you are really doing is training the immune system. This has been done very successfully, and I believe it is one of our great assets—whether in this case with tuberculosis antigens, or with staphylococcus antigens, as there is also a vaccine that showed very good results, or with antigens from microbes like Borrelia, Bartonella, Babesia, Herpesviruses, etc. This, in my opinion, would indeed be a therapy that creates perfect synergy with all those immune-stimulating treatments that reverse the pathways microbes have tweaked to their advantage.\nChron’s, IBS, and other severe gut treatment\nI believe I can give you some very good advice, as I’ve been through something quite terrible and very related. There came a point when I couldn’t eat anything at all. I lost 20 kilos, and at 1.75 meters tall, I dropped to 49 kilos and was in a deplorable state. It’s possible I should have had my colon removed. A CT scan showed no issues, and I decided not to undergo a colonoscopy since it would have caused me to lose another 2 or 3 kilos, which I didn’t want. I tried every type of medication with no effect. So, I studied absolutely all the alternatives in great depth.\nI can tell you that a 100% carnivore diet possibly saved my life and undoubtedly spared me from losing my colon. My colon endured a year of chronic diarrhea every single day, followed by two years of complete paralysis where I couldn’t go to the bathroom on my own even once. I had to empty myself every 15 days with a double hydrocolonic therapy.\nThe symptoms were terrible: dyspepsia, excruciating pain, tremors, cold, gas, colic-like pain, etc.\nThere are several published studies on complete remissions of ulcerative colitis and possibly Crohn’s disease with a highly ketogenic carnivore diet. There are also very good studies on Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis with non-carnivore ketogenic diets, but I highly recommend you try carnivore.\nThe transition can be a bit challenging, but I’m willing to help you since I’ve been studying this topic extensively and have lived this first hand.\nIn terms of treatments, for now, and while transitioning to the appropriate diet, I would recommend Budesonide. It’s a corticosteroid that primarily acts on the gastrointestinal tract and won’t cause the systemic side effects typical of other corticosteroids. Additionally, Mesalazine will help you a lot.\nI highly recommend buying GcMAF as it will heal the underlying cause. I’d also consider LDN for the same reason.\nFortunately, I believe this is a disease that the vast majority of people can cure as long as they maintain the proper diet.\nI suggest you watch the videos by Dr. Nick Norowitz, who recently published a case study on a carnivore diet for ulcerative colitis. He cured his ulcerative colitis himself:\nyoutu.be/JJQCwsy_yM8\nI hope this helps, and I wish you lots of strength through it all.\nChronic infections\nI am aware that in the scientific world of ME/CFS, and therefore in many patients, the prevailing idea is that there are patients with infections and patients without them. But if you study the immune system properly, you know that a depressed immune system always goes hand in hand with chronic infections, because everyone harbors chronic infections, and as soon as the immune system drops, they proliferate. A very clear example is the drop in immunity in HIV or simply by cold exposure or by physical/emotional stress, when you get an HSV-1 or HSV-2 flare, or shingles.\nTherefore, if the only way out is to gradually raise the immune system so that it can take charge of the infections—and possibly, if necessary, address these infections with antimicrobials directly—while also dealing with other important aspects such as detoxification, elimination of fermentable gut content, removal of heavy metals, etc., this immune stimulation will have undesirable consequences. Just as the flu has acute symptoms, in severe chronic ME/CFS you will experience worsening in the form of flu-like symptoms, low-grade fever, increased malaise, fatigue, etc. But it is very possible that this is inevitable in order to reach a true cure\nThe only way to mitigate this effect is to take very small doses and increase them very gradually, even over months or years, until the body slowly tolerates a greater amount of immune stimulation. The same applies to mast cell degranulation: it will be necessary to go slowly and support this process with antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, a low-histamine diet, etc. Thus, in my opinion, I believe the evidence supports that MENK is not especially prone to promote mast cell degranulation, although in a very extreme case it is not inconceivable that at the subcutaneous level there could be some irritation. Systemically, I don’t think this is likely, though the risk is always there. But in addition to this, I would also say that perhaps in general terms it is inevitable to experience some degree of immune activation in order to achieve a definitive cure.\nKnowing CDR stage is important\nIt’s also very important to know which CDR phase you’re in, because if you’re in CDR1 — a highly pro-inflammatory phase — anti-inflammatory therapies might help you move forward into the next phases and eventually out of the CDR, where the cell is repaired and functioning normally. For example, if you’re in CDR1 or CDR2, it makes little sense to take, for example, CoQ10, since the mitochondria won’t use it and you might even worsen your condition. But if you’re already recovering, where your cells might be in CDR3, then you can start to introduce mitochondrial supplements. So, knowing which phase we’re in is extremely useful to build a clinical treatment strategy.\nIs CDR a theory or a proven model?\nOkay, I see your point. You’re partly right, but not entirely IMO. For instance, we know perfectly well that macrophages follow this CDR sequence — they show a CDR1 phenotype when activated, shift into CDR2 as they begin to deactivate, and finally reach CDR3 when they return to their M2 phenotype. Likewise, when you stimulate any type of immune cell — including NKs, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and so on — you observe exactly the same pattern, and always in the same order. You can trigger it through extracellular ATP, antigenic stimulation via MHC I or MHC II, LPS exposure via TLR4, OR with other alarmins such as ROS/RNS, interferon-γ, or interferon-α.\nExtrapolating this to complex biological systems, we also see the same sequence in virtually any acute infection, like COVID-19 or influenza, as well as in chronic infections such as tuberculosis or HIV. You see a strong inflammatory phenotype early on — fully consistent with what’s expected from CDR1 — followed by an exhaustion phase that clearly corresponds to CDR2.\nThere are other fascinating examples as well, such as hepatitis C. In the first months and years of infection, hepatocytes clearly meet the criteria for CDR1, and as the disease progresses, they perfectly match the criteria for CDR2. It’s also remarkable that, at a systemic level, the immune system itself mirrors this progression from CDR1 to CDR3.\nIn the same way, systemic diseases that fall within the CDR2 state — such as pulmonary fibrosis, cancer, or diabetes — show precisely what one would expect: intense cellular proliferation, markedly elevated TGF-β levels driving extensive scar-tissue formation, and tissue overgrowth across different organs depending on the disease. It’s therefore easy to identify conditions that fit within the CDR2 phenotype, because their underlying cellular mechanisms are reflected systemically.\nFinally, as you surely know, Naviaux also described how the main signal that transmits perceived danger from one cell to the rest of the body is extracellular ATP. There are hundreds of studies documenting the role of extracellular ATP and how it triggers all kinds of CDR-related phenomena across every possible tissue and disease context. Moreover, there’s experimental evidence — both in animals and in humans — showing that antipurinergic therapies can reverse autism in mice and significantly improve symptoms in children, with one study using a single dose of suramin and another using three doses. That provides direct support for this part of the CDR model proposed by Naviaux.\nAnd we have even more evidence, again highlighting the role of ATP as the key danger signal perpetuating the CDR: when ATP is injected into a mouse, mitochondrial oxygen consumption drops by about 70%. All the expected parameters of acute CDR have been demonstrated by Naviaux in these animal studies and partially reproduced in autistic children with specific measurable biomarkers.\nAnother cell type where the CDR1 → CDR2 → CDR3 progression is particularly evident — regardless of the lineage you study — is senescent cells. The initial stress drives them into CDR1, with all the hallmark features of that state, and they eventually settle into CDR3, again showing the expected traits of that phase. So yes, there’s still plenty of research to be done, but this is by no means theoretical IMO. We’re talking about a predictable sequence of cellular reactions that can be observed both at the cellular and systemic levels across a wide range of biological systems.\nIf CDR is the same across diseases, why are symptoms different?\n\nI guess the big q is why other chronic infections, or for that matter anything that features the same CDR state that we are in, do not show PEM or other typical ME/CFS symptoms. So if you’re saying that other (chronic) diseases are stuck in CDR1/CDR3, there must be more going on on top of the cells being stuck in CDR. But actually, you said that any deviation from homeostasis is accounted for by CDR. So rather, what I’m wondering is, which particular pathway is different in ME/CFS vs these other CDR1/CDR3 states that do not feature our symptoms. Because if CDR describes the commonalities among all chronic disease states, I am personally rather interested in the differences between these disease states, ie what makes ME/CFS ME/CFS. Eg I imagine reverse electorn transfer is a universal response whenever the ETC is inhibited, so there has to be more going on during PEM in ME/CFS.\nMy guess would be that it depends on the cell types affected, and the composition of pathways that can stay chronically active according to CDR, which is very likely dfiferent for all diessses.\nIn that case what can the CDR theory predict for us?\n\nYou’re asking truly excellent questions — and I completely agree that these are the key issues to examine when approaching our illness through the lens of the Cell Danger Response (CDR).\nOf course, the symptoms of any given disease depend on which cells are affected and on the state of the immune system. If the immune system is in a strongly pro-inflammatory phase, it may drive autoimmunity, whereas if it’s in an exhausted state, it tends to result in chronic infection with low-grade inflammation. The initial trigger is equally important: different “master” infections — such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella, or Babesia — can produce distinct clinical pictures depending not only on the pathogen but also on the tissues they inhabit. For example, Borrelia in the heart can lead to pericarditis; in the CNS it has been associated with Alzheimer’s-like pathology; and when it predominates in muscle and connective tissue, it often manifests as migratory pain or fibromyalgia-type symptoms.\nIt’s also crucial to consider cases in which pathogenic autoantibodies are clearly involved and cause characteristic tissue inflammation, as described in the recent paper on interferon-γ and low-affinity antibodies — a mechanism that does not seem to occur in ME/CFS. In such diseases, the origin of those antibodies matters enormously. Often it’s molecular mimicry to infectious antigens; in other cases, it arises from immune reactivity to gut-derived food antigens or to GAD peptides. This could explain why some people with multiple sclerosis experience total remission on a strict carnivore diet yet relapse once they reintroduce common foods.\nYour question about why such similar immune signatures can underlie very different diseases is an excellent one. If you compare the immune profiles of patients with long-term HIV, tuberculosis, or chronic hepatitis, you’ll see the same pattern: a blunted Th1 response, elevated anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β1, poor NK cytotoxicity, macrophage and dendritic-cell anergy, and persistent low-grade inflammation. The difference lies mainly in tissue tropism — in hepatitis the liver bears the brunt, in HIV the immune system and CNS are heavily affected, and in tuberculosis the lungs are the primary target — but systemically, immune exhaustion looks remarkably similar across them all.\nWe might speculate that in ME/CFS, Borrelia burgdorferi infection (present, I suspect, in nearly all patients) plays a major role. Yet why some individuals develop neurological or migratory-pain syndromes while others fall into a profound fatigue state remains unexplained.\nWhat we do know is that in ME/CFS the immune dysfunction mirrors that seen in chronic infections and even in cancer: infected or transformed cells both drive immunosuppressive signals that culminate in immune exhaustion. At the cellular level, immune cells lose their ability to produce ATP — and once that happens across many cell types, systemic fatigue and metabolic dysregulation are inevitable.\nAny cell exposed to sustained stress — whether immune or tissue — follows the same sequence: initial pro-inflammatory activation (CDR phase 1), then, if the stress persists, metabolic downregulation with suppressed glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. These hypometabolic cells are essentially the cellular correlate of systemic CDR persistence in ME/CFS. Numerous chronic post-infectious conditions converge on this same hypometabolic phenotype — what Naviaux grouped under CDR type A — including ME/CFS and Long COVID.\nGiven this, independent of the specific infection involved, there must be genetic predispositions that influence which disease phenotype emerges under chronic inflammatory stress. Some people with Lyme develop localized neurological, muscular, or cardiac syndromes without systemic hypometabolism, while others progress straight into a hypometabolic, fatigue-dominant state. We don’t yet understand why, but this is a key question for future study.\nExtracellular ATP, as Naviaux demonstrated, is perhaps the strongest “danger signal” known. Injecting ATP into mice suppresses mitochondrial respiration by roughly 70%, directly inducing a hypometabolic state. Similarly, in immune cells, incremental ATP exposure first activates them, then over-activates, and finally drives apoptosis or exhaustion. This same signaling logic applies system-wide.\nInterestingly, antipurinergic interventions seem to help across the entire CDR spectrum — whether the disease is autoimmune and pro-inflammatory (like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), oncologic, or infectious with immune suppression— tending to restore homeostasis. The same principle holds for drugs like rapamycin, which normalizes immune tone in either direction — stimulating when suppressed, calming when overactive. The same could be said for JHU compounds that modulate glutamine metabolism, for MENK— LDN shows this bidirectional homeostatic effect across autoimmunity, cancer, and chronic infection—, for ISR activation, for  VDR agonism,  possibly for IRG1 inhibition, for any therapy that oxidizes NADH into NAD+, etc. (perhaps this is not true for AHR that depends on the CDR status).\nSo, while we don’t yet know precisely which cells are primarily affected or why some individuals develop a hypometabolic phenotype while others develop localized tissue inflammation, we do know that the therapeutic goal must be restoration of homeostasis — by reducing the false “danger” signals that perpetuate the CDR. The main drivers of these alarm signals are chronic infections, toxins, nutrient deficiencies, and self-reinforcing positive feedback loops that sustain sterile inflammation.\nAmong exogenous triggers, the most impactful are likely mycotoxins from water-damaged buildings, tick-borne and vector-borne pathogens (transmitted also by mosquitoes or fleas), heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and chronic oral sources such as root canals or cavitations.\nEach individual may have additional idiosyncratic exposures.\nAnother very important self-perpetuating cycle is the fermenting gut, which needs to be addressed as well IMO.\nTargeting all infections or not\nAs for internal infections, many of us harbor over a dozen latent or persistent microbes when tested deeply. It’s impractical and counterproductive to attack them all with endless antimicrobials; without immune restoration, these treatments fail — explaining why long-term antibiotic courses rarely eradicate Borrelia or co-infections in immunosuppressed patients.\nA more logical strategy is twofold:\n(1) Reduce avoidable exposures — for example, chelating heavy metals, supporting detoxification through saunas, Epsom-salt baths, MSM, or phosphatidylcholine infusions — and\n(2) Target the shared CDR pathways that restore immune competence, allowing the body itself gradually to regain control of chronic infections, potentially complemented by individualized antimicrobials.\nIf that’s insufficient, additional layers might involve breaking sterile self-perpetuating cycles with agents like filgotinib, daratumumab, or ixazomib, or neuromodulatory approaches such as transcranial ultrasound or electromagnetic stimulation to calm limbic-system hypervigilance. Peptides and therapies that rebalance CRFR2 and serotonergic tone, and even, —and much to my regret— neurocognitive retraining programs like Gupta or DNRS (for those stable enough to perform them), can be helpful — conceptually similar to phantom-limb rehabilitation, retraining the brain to stop perpetuating maladaptive feedback loops.\nInterventions depend on CDR stage\nIn response to your question: If the CDR truly encompasses all the cellular defense mechanisms that can be activated under any type of stress, then what specific insight or explanatory value does it actually offer us?\nFirst of all, Naviaux discovered that there is a universal order that cells must follow to repair themselves and eliminate stress. If this is not possible, they enter apoptosis, thereby removing the damaged element from the organism.\nSecondly, he classified diseases according to the estimated percentage of cells trapped in each of the three CDR stages, which is incredibly useful.\nFor example, acute diseases such as acute infections fall under CDR1, where the innate immune response predominates. When the damage is severe, cells can undergo apoptosis or even necrosis. At the cellular level, we see increased cytoplasmic anaerobic respiration and reduced mitochondrial oxidative respiration. This phase is characterized by elevated ROS, inflammasome activation (NLRP3) leading to IL-1β and IL-18 release, and upregulation of SAMe and the transsulfuration pathway to produce GSH.\nIn CDR2, the predominant features are cell proliferation and fibrosis, as seen in cancer, diabetes, and similar conditions. Fibrotic and granulomatous processes are common, and when the damage is excessive, cells can enter senescence.\nFinally, in CDR3, cells begin to recover mitochondrial respiration and re-establish connections with neighboring cells, much like the late phase of wound healing. However, in chronic disease, when cells remain stuck in this phase, we find a state of cellular exhaustion in which both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration are depressed, inflammation is low, lactate may be reduced, and overall cellular anergy predominates.\nFrom this framework, many things can be inferred: For instance, anti-inflammatory drugs are more likely to work during CDR1, but not in CDR3. Likewise, mitochondrial supplements often fail in CDR3A (the subtype that includes ME/CFS or Long COVID), because when the mitochondria are shut down, adding cofactors is useless or even counterproductive.\nSimilarly, in CDR2, it makes little sense to give anabolic hormones, as this could worsen cancer or other proliferative states.\nThese are just basic examples showing that, depending on the CDR phase, some interventions may help while others may harm—and that already has major therapeutic implications.\nMitochondria are not damaged\nAnother crucial point in Naviaux’s work is his demonstration that the mitochondria themselves are not structurally damaged. The problem is not a mechanical failure but a metabolic signaling state. According to him, the main danger signal is extracellular ATP, though other molecules—certain immunoglobulins, mtDNA, succinate, IFN-α, or TGF-β1—can also play similar roles IMO.\nNaviaux also showed that in autistic mouse models, administration of suramin reversed all metabolic abnormalities: neurological deficits, gut microbiome changes, methylation defects, and even mitochondrial function. This demonstrates that the pathology is driven by aberrant mitochondrial signaling, not by irreversible cellular or tissue damage.\nWhy do individual treatments not work?\nNow, how does all this translate to ME/CFS?\nFor many years I understood the anomalies seen in this disease and the treatments proposed, but I couldn’t connect them.\nI knew about infections like Lyme, viral reactivations, heavy metals, elevated RNase-L, NK cell dysfunction, mitochondrial inefficiency, POTS, low GSH, high ROS/RNA or methylation cycle deficits. Yet none of the targeted treatments—methylation support, antivirals, antibiotics, probiotics or mitochondrial therapies—produced significant or lasting improvement.\nNow I understand why: The methylation block is secondary to the oxidative state that arises when mitochondria stop using oxygen to recycle ATP. Thus, it follows the mitochondrial shutdown. If the mitochondria are closed, mitochondrial supplements won’t work. And if detoxification and immune capacity are weak, even mild detox attempts can worsen symptoms—as happened to me.\nIf immune cells themselves are stuck in a CDR, they are metabolically exhausted, so antimicrobials will fail simply because an effective immune response is missing.\nRecognizing that this is a signaling disorder shifts the focus to identifying everything that might be sending danger signals—toxins, radiation, mycotoxins, infections (Borrelia, Babesia, herpesviruses), and so on.\nAfter long-term illness, structural conditions such as EDS or CCI may also develop. Although probably secondary to a chronic CDR, they too emit persistent danger signals and often require direct interventions, even surgery.\nDietary antigens are another major source of exogenous danger signals.\nTherefore, the diet must be cleaned of all potential allergens—gluten, casein/caseomorphins, lectins, oxalates, etc.—and gut fermentation must be reduced to prevent the entry of LPS, ammonia, D-lactate, alcohols, and other metabolites that inhibit mitochondria and chronically activate innate immunity.\nBecause we are in a hypometabolic CDR, the immune system becomes exhausted and can no longer control latent infections, which then become endogenous sources of danger. The solution isn’t merely antimicrobials (which fail without immune competence) but to lift immune cells out of the CDR.\nHow to study CDR?\nTo study this, we can look for simple, observable models that scale to systemic behavior. We know that the primary trigger of the CDR is extracellular ATP. Interestingly, low doses of ATP can stimulate immunity, while high doses overstimulate it and lead to apoptosis or immune exhaustion.\nThis can be modeled in vitro in any immune cell type—by continuous LPS stimulation via TLRs, antigenic stimulation of T cells via TCR, or NK receptor activation. Immune cells go through the same three CDR-like phases: initial pro-inflammatory activation (CDR1), proliferation and senescence (CDR2), and finally immune exhaustion (CDR3).\nBy studying how immune exhaustion develops, and which pathways are engaged during the early CDR1 activation that ultimately cause it, we can identify the molecular targets needed to reverse it. Here we find critical roles for purinergic signaling, mTOR, ISR, Nagalase, TGF-β1, PGE2, GDF15, VDR inhibition by microbes, mtDNA release after calcium enters the mitochondria, IFN-α/JAK1/ACOD1/itaconate, interferon-stimulated genes that promotes immune-supressive molecules like arginase, PD-1, CTLA-4, or SOCS, glutamine metabolism in infected cells, GSK-3β, mitochondrial reductive stress (high NADH/NAD⁺), acetyl-CoA depletion by itaconate and PDH inhibition, excess flux through the PPP causing BH4/BH2 imbalance causing NOS uncoupling and a shift from NO to ROS production. Moreover, excess NADPH from the PPP drives additional ROS formation via NOX enzymes.\nAll these events follow a specific sequence that reproduces itself consistently during immune exhaustion.\nWhen these pathways are experimentally targeted one by one in vitro, immune function can be restored. Similarly in in vivo models of chronic infection or cancer, blocking purinergic signaling, inhibiting glutamine metabolism, suppressing mTOR, or activating the ISR all normalize immune function and reverse disease.\nHence, we already have a clear roadmap of molecular targets capable of reversing the main alarm signals that keep the organism locked in the disease state.\nComplications in long-term illness\nIn a complex human system after many years of illness, of course, things get much more complicated. As @c  pointed out, there are privileged niches inaccessible to immune cells, where infections can persist. Pathogens form biofilms that also prevent immune access. And even without active infection, inflammatory signals and autoreactive antibodies or T cells can perpetuate the process.\nThere is also a neurological memory of disease—demonstrated in animal models—where mere neuronal activation can reproduce sickness behavior and hypometabolism even in the absence of infection.\nThe limbic system itself, upon receiving systemic inflammatory signals—either directly or through the vagus nerve—induces what is known as sickness behavior, possibly mediated by CRFR2 receptors and an excess of serotonergic tone.\nOver time, we accumulate toxins and dormant infections that must be cleared. Multiple sterile feedback loops—alarmins, gut-derived LPS, extracellular ATP, reactive oxygen species, mtDNA, succinate, fibronectin fragments—all reinforce the chronic “disease homeostasis.”\nYet, across diverse models—HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, numerous cancers—inhibition of purinergic signaling, or addressing some of the pathways I described above, consistently reactivates immunity and eliminates disease, regardless of the tissue or symptoms.\nTherefore, it seems a reasonable inference that the same could apply to us.\nBy extending Naviaux’s CDR framework to the immune system and our own pathophysiology, we finally have a coherent mechanistic model—and a therapeutic roadmap that, if targeted correctly, I hope could restore normal homeostasis again.\nTemporary remissions\nyou’ll notice that for most of my 20 years of illness I knew a lot of the parts of the ME/CFS pathophysiology but couldn’t connect the dots until about three years ago, when I carried out the research described in that same message.\nThat work led me to develop my current theory, which I haven’t yet been able to put fully into practice: Initially, both my partner and I focused solely on taking antipurinergic compounds for 1.5 years, and we realized it really seemed to be the right path — the immune system improved greatly, many lab parameters normalized, and both of us tested negative for Lyme after 10 and 20 years of unsuccessful treatments. However, it wasn’t enough to fully reverse the immunosuppression or produce substantial clinical recovery, so I expanded my theory to include other pathways and potential treatments.\nAt my current stage, I cannot tolerate most treatments because I developed a kind of chronic vasovagal syndrome after a duodenal ulcer I caused myself. We also believe that the GcMAF, which once helped me so much, is essential to establish a foundation from which all other therapies can work better. We’re waiting until we can produce the proper GcMAF again and see it function as it once did before introducing the other therapies.\nIn any case, in the past—before I had the current level of understanding that allows me to connect most of the pieces—I did focus on strengthening the immune system, since it made sense given the infections and immune deficiencies, and I achieved very good results with LDN and GcMAF. I improved from being 99% bedridden to the point where I could go back to the gym, drive, and attend university again. I didn’t fully recover, but I reached a high level of improvement that I later lost when GcMAF was no longer available. That experience made me realize that supporting the immune system was essential, because it resolved all my gut problems and many other symptoms that had seemed completely unrelated to immunity — such as severe cognitive impairment, word-finding difficulties, inability to follow conversations, or brain fog — and it even allowed me to regain weight after seven years in a highly catabolic state and being significantly underweight.\nLater, in medical school, while studying microbiology, I learned that Lyme disease, specifically Borrelia, does not directly cause symptoms; rather, it’s the immune system itself that produces them, driven by bacterial immune-modulation. That insight led me to study low-dose antigen therapies in depth, and eventually I went to the United States to obtain LDI (Low Dose Immune Therapy). This treatment managed to fully cure and render my mother asymptomatic for several years, greatly improved my partner — who went from being bedridden to going out dancing and seeing her friends — and twice gave me the most dramatic improvement I’ve ever experienced in twenty years.\nUnfortunately, those effects gradually faded, and we were never able to stabilize the therapy, but it provided another key realization: the core problem lies in the immune system and its regulatory signaling. Seeing both my mother and my partner recover overnight — from being bedridden to going out without fatigue, pain, MCS or brain fog — confirmed that this is a signaling problem, not structural damage.\nPrecise flow\nSo, I started by digging into Naviaux’s papers, where he explains how the Cell Danger Response encompasses several well-known biological processes such as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), the Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response (mtUPR), the chaperone response, etc. I decided to study these pathways in detail and how they’re linked to microbes — how microbes activate them to their own advantage and to immunosuppress us — and then how all these stress pathways interconnect. As I started putting the pieces together, I realized there were always a few key components. Extracellular ATP was always present; purinergic receptors were essential to initiate the cascade; and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) triggered by microbial components also set everything in motion. Then, once you look at how mitochondria fit into these processes — and how immune exhaustion itself is connected to mitochondrial dysfunction — everything starts to make sense.\nIf you study the most obvious example, like how a macrophage or a T lymphocyte gets activated, you see that activation requires a massive amount of protein synthesis to produce cytokines and effector molecules. This causes endoplasmic reticulum stress, because the ER becomes overloaded folding those proteins. As a result, the UPR is activated to trigger the ISR, which in turn induces antioxidant programs to counteract the surge of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increases protease and chaperone activity to assist protein folding, and decreases the synthesis of non-essential proteins. In infected non-immune cells, this downregulation of host protein synthesis helps prevent microbes from hijacking the host’s RNA to make their own proteins.\nNaturally, all this requires enormous amounts of energy, which is where mTOR comes in — mobilizing resources for both glucose and fatty acid oxidation. The mitochondria must run at maximum capacity, so extracellular ATP activates purinergic receptors, allowing calcium to flood into the cytosol, then into the ER, and subsequently into the mitochondria. Initially, this boosts oxidative phosphorylation, increases ATP output, and strongly polarizes the mitochondrial membrane. All these processes are necessary for immune activation — but if the activation is prolonged, that’s when problems begin. The mitochondria start to stall; excess ROS accumulates; mTOR and ROS both inhibit mitochondrial function; peroxynitrite, nitric oxide, and TGF-β1 further suppress it, creating even more oxidative stress. This upregulates NOX enzymes, producing still more ROS. As the mitochondria fail, reductive stress builds up — excess electrons react with oxygen that’s no longer properly reduced, generating additional radicals. This keeps the UPR, mtUPR, and ISR chronically active until they collapse: the ISR becomes exhausted, the UPR overflows, and more calcium and ROS are dumped into the mitochondria, worsening the damage.\nWe could go on — purinergic signaling also directly activates mTOR and interferon genes, which over time leads to immunosuppression and production of itaconate, a metabolite that’s initially pro-inflammatory but later inhibits the Krebs cycle and acts as a strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive signal. I’m recalling all this from memory, and there are many more pathways and steps involved, but the main idea is that the same machinery that fuels energy production and protein synthesis during immune activation will eventually cause immune exhaustion if it stays on too long. These programs evolved for acute infections, not chronic ones — so what saves you in the short term acting as breaks of the excessuve inflammation, becomes immunosuppressive in the long term. And microbes take advantage of that. They actively modulate these pathways to push the system toward this suppressed, chronic state.\nCommonalities between stages\nSo you’re absolutely right: any of these elements, when you look at them in context, behave similarly regardless of whether you’re in a pro-inflammatory (CDR1) or an anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressed (CDR3) state. For instance, mTOR tends to be elevated both in inflammatory and in immunosuppressive diseases. So lowering it relieves mitochondrial inhibition and ER stress — what can either decrease inflammation or, paradoxically, restore it if that’s what’s needed. Similarly, blocking purinergic signaling improves a wide range of inflammatory conditions — autoimmune diseases, autism, Alzheimer’s — while in infections  (acute or chronic) and cancer, it can enhance immune function and mitochondrial efficiency, regardless of the CDR phase. The only exception might be the AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) pathway, which I haven’t explored in depth yet in pro-inflammatory conditions. In autoimmune diseases, AHR expression actually seems to be reduced, which might make this axis unique in that it’s state depends on the CDR phenotype.\nUnknowns\nWe’ll likely find other relevant targets within the CDR framework — for example, the calcium channels that regulate mitochondrial calcium influx or the pores that release mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm. I’m not sure yet if those are central in cases of deep immunosuppression, but I suspect they might be.\nWhat’s hardest, in my view, is finding therapies that truly work. For instance, in one ex vivo study on ME/CFS, salubrinal (which acts like Sephin-1) completely restored mitochondrial function. Yet in practice, Sephin-1 only slightly helps some patients. I don’t think that means the pathway is unimportant — I think the drug just isn’t potent enough. The same applies to antipurinergic drugs — we probably need suramin or similar compounds, and for extended periods. Or probably, we need sinergy of multiple pathways at once, and side effects/interactions here might be an issue.\nThe area I’ve studied least — and where I think the next big breakthroughs might come — is the limbic system and amygdala involvement. In mice, for example, if you activate the same neurons that are triggered during intestinal infection, you can reproduce the entire illness in healthy animals. That tells us there’s a neural memory perpetuating the disease — the so-called sickness behavior. It’s obvious, because a person with moderate ME/CFS who takes amphetamines suddenly feels completely normal; you’re basically tricking the brain out of the sickness program. The hypothesis behind the CT38 project was fascinating — inhibiting CRFR2 to lower serotonergic tone in the brainstem might be one piece of that puzzle. I don’t know if it’s the whole story, but it’s an area that still has a lot to reveal.\nLastly, I think immune training could be crucial. Vaccines like BCG or staphylococcal vaccines have shown promising results. I’ve already mentioned my own experience — and that of my mother and partner — with homeopathic dilutions of tick-borne bacterial antigens. There are also remarkable studies using sublingual hepatitis antigens, showing full recovery and restoration of immune homeostasis. So I believe potential therapies could include real sublingual antigens for common chronic viruses like cytomegalovirus, HHV-6, and Epstein-Barr, as well as components like mycolic acid, which likely explains part of why the BCG vaccine works so well.\nSo yeah, still a lot to research, learn and try!! :)!\nPS. By the way, regarding nagalase, there’s very little research available, and so far I haven’t been able to find any evidence showing that infected or exhausted cells actually synthesize and release nagalase from their membranes. Still, I think this is a very real possibility, and if confirmed, it would directly link nagalase activity to the CDR.\nWhat is known, though, is that all microbes analyzed so far—viruses, bacteria, and even some fungi—express and release nagalase, which is one of the most potent immunosuppressive enzymes identified. It blocks the immune response right at its initiation point, acting on dendritic cells and macrophages, essentially cutting off antigen presentation and adaptive activation.\nAs for opioid receptors, I still haven’t found a clear explanation for why their activity decreases during the CDR. What I do know, for instance, is that when methionine levels drop—due to reduced organic sulfur flow through the methylation cycle caused by deficiencies in active vitamins B12 and B9—the synthesis of 5-methionine enkephalin (MENK) from phosphatidylethanolamine is reduced. So it makes sense that we produce less MENK\nBut we also have fewer beta-endorphins… This might be linked to the instability of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) when BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin) is depleted—both because of methylation defects and because peroxynitrite oxidizes BH4. There must be a fixed mechanistic link there somewhere; I’m sure of it.\nAnother thing I forgot to mention: if you want to identify which pathways are disrupted in ME/CFS within the hypometabolic phenotype, it’s extremely useful to study the metabolic pathways that drive and sustain cellular senescence.

BAC is needed to keep bacteria out, sterile won’t do. Even BAC is not a foolproof solution, but it greatly reduces risk.\n\n\n\n\nComponents must meet USP specs. BAC also meets a specific pH range suitable for peptides, others may damage it. Even the vial materials need to be specific not to change the pH much, which is why I recommend Hospira below.\n\n\n⚠️ do NOT buy BAC from Amazon, see why\n[best] Hospira/Pfizer:\n\n\n\nVery hard to get as it’s an rx product usually only available to licensed suppliers, even though it’s “just” water.\n\n\nwhy it’s superior\nlicensed medical suppliers that sell w/o rx: US - currently the only one\n\nUS source but comes out to $7-8/vial with shipping and customs, while EU sources are usually $20-30/vial (example)\nit’s a no-brainer in the US at $4/vial\n\n\n\n\n⚠️ There are many shady sites asking for 3-10x this price or straight up selling fakes, which could be very dangerous to inject. This is not an area where you want to penny-pinch.\n\n\n\n\n[alternative] your peptide source may have purity tested BAC for a similar price or cheaper\n\n$2.5/10ml is common with Chinese sources\nother sources (like BioLab) will straight up rip you off at $10/10ml (4-7x Hospira)\n\n\n[advanced] DIY:\n\npharma-grade 50-100ml sterile water in vials - DE\npharma-grade benzyl-alcohol, usually comes in 0.5-1L size for €70 and will last you a lifetime - DE\n\nneeds to be: “Endotoxin Free” or “For Parenteral Applications” (Parenteral=for injection)\n\n\nuse a syringe to get 0.9% of BA into the steril water (e.g. 1cc syringe filled to 0.9cc with BA)\nguide,  additional info\n\n\n\nSyringes, needles\n\n\n\nThe idea is to use two types of syringes: one for reconstituting the peptide, another for injection. The former uses a larger needle (27G) and can be either modular or a simple non-modular unit, while the ones for injecting should be modular so you can attach a filter and a thinner needle (29G or 30G).\n\n\n\n\nFor modular syringes, there are two connection types: luer slip/taper and luer lock. Latter is preferred as it’s more secure.\n\n\n\n\n⚠️ Only buy pharma-grade components, meaning they must be: sterile (individually packaged), depyrogenized, non-toxic, non-latex (some are allergic to it), non-PVC, non-DEHP, &amp; ISO 13485 compliant.\n\n\n\nsyringe: 1cc/ml 100U luer lock: UK\n\n\n\n‘U’ stands for units, and you want it to be 100 to make dosing precise and easy. 100U should be 1ml.\n\n\n\n\nIf 1cc syringes are more expensive than alternatives, like in my case, you can get 2-3cc syringes for mixing to save some money, as mixing needs less accuracy (usually increments of 1ml are used), while 1cc 100U is more important for injecting as smaller doses are injected (5-10U).\n\n\n\n\n\nneedles:\n\n\n\n‘G’ stands for gauge, i.e. the diameter.\n\n\npinning needle: has to be thin, 29-30G 1/2” luer lock: UK\n\nif you have thick fat layer under skin, may want a longer needle\nideally low dead space for pinning needles (only important to save substance, not a requirement)\n\n\nfor reconstitution: you can use a thicker needle if it’s cheaper: e.g. 27G 3/4-1” luer lock: UK\n\n[alternative] one-piece or pre-assembled luer insulin syringe for reconstitution, can be cheaper\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\nmost guides don’t mention this, but IMO it’s a must: rationale\n\nprotein aggregates may form that can cause an unwanted immune reaction\nthere can be contaminants\n\n\n\n\nI would use a filter with every injection. This makes it more expensive, but it lowers risk. You could also filter once during reconstitution into a sterile vial, but I couldn’t find sterile sealed pharma-grade empty vials in my region (don’t trust Amazon). US\n\n\n\n\nMany inject without filters and are fine, but you probably don’t want to tempt fate.\n\n\n\n\nPurity ratings are always after filtering!!! E.g. Janoshik for sure always tests with 0.22 μm filters. This means CoA does not pick up degradation of actives due to protein aggregates at all.\n\n\nmembrane material:\n\nhydrophilic: to allow. water flow\n\n(if you are injecting oils, not covered here, must be oleophilic/hydrophobic)\n\n\n[best] PES: preferred, lowest protein binding capacity\n\n\n\nLow protein binding capacity is important to not waste your peptides.\n\n\nCN/global DE\n\n\n[alternative] PVDF-L: slightly higher protein binding capacity\nAVOID: PVDF-H, PTFE, nylon or cellulose acetate\n\n\n\nThese have high protein binding capacity or are hydrophilic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2 μm (or 0.22 μm) filters are best for sterility &amp;

For complex mutations you need SV/CNV, which includes structural variants (≥50 bp: deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, translocations) - and copy number variants (dosage gains/losses).\n\n\nrequired headers: reference build ID; SV caller name + version; FILTERs; standard SV INFO tags (e.g., SVTYPE, END)\n\n\nBAM + BAI (for evidence review) – recommended\n\nrequired headers:\n\n@SQ with sequence names (and preferably M5 MD5 tags)\n@PG with aligner name + version\n@RG read groups (SM sample, LB library, PL platform, PU unit)\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles you do not need for analysis but I would recommend anyway:\n\nFASTQ (see below)\nQC reports: %Q30, mapping %, dup % (post mark-dup), mean depth, %≥10× / %≥30×, insert-size stats\n\nalso useful for checking whether a rerun is necessary\n\n\n\nUse case: rerun / realignment / re-calling\n\nSome reasons you might want to rerun later: improved tooling in the future may pick up variants current technology does not, genome database gets updated, joint analysis with family members, fix lab choices if you can’t get all the requirements listed here, etc.\n\nCore files\n\neverything from above – REQUIRED\n\n\nFASTQ (R1/R2, raw, unfiltered) – REQUIRED\n\nrequired read group info (@RG): SM (sample), LB (library), PL (platform), PU (unit), CN (center)\n\nsupply if not embedded\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely essential; all reprocessing starts here. For this reason I always recommend asking for the FASTQ file.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, can use BAM as optional starting point (saves you alignment time), but if you want to change reference/parameters, you’ll usually prefer to start from FASTQ. Also useful to compare against original alignment.\n\n\n\n\ngVCF + index (per-sample) – recommended\n\nrequired headers: reference build; caller name + version; ploidy assumptions if noted\nNOTE: this file will be quite large\n\n\nEnables joint (re)genotyping later without re-calling from scratch.\n\n\n\n\ncoverage files (mosdepth BED/TSV/BigWig) – recommended\n\n\n\nTo pinpoint low-coverage regions and reproducible from BAM.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal metadata\n\nEssential for exact reproducibility or to interpret BAM/VCF correctly.\n\n\nreference FASTA ID - REQUIRED\n\nExact filename (e.g., GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa)\nChecksum (MD5/SHA256)\nNote whether ALT/decoy present or if hg38.primary used\n\n\nreference genome ID - REQUIRED\n\nBuild label (e.g., GRCh38.p13) + chromosome naming scheme\n\n\nknown sites VCFs\n\ndbSNP + Mills &amp; 1000G indels (filenames, versions, checksums)\n\n\ntoolchain versions\n\naligner: name + version (e.g., BWA-MEM2 2.2.1 / DRAGEN aligner 4.2)\nSNV/indel caller: name + version (e.g., GATK HC 4.3.0 / DeepVariant 1.6 / DRAGEN germline 4.2)\nSV/CNV caller(s): name + version (e.g., Manta 1.6.0, gCNV)\npost-proc: mark-dup tool/version (Picard/GATK/DRAGEN), BQSR tool/version + resource sets used\nVCF ops: bcftools/htslib versions (if used)\n\n\nchecksums for deliverables\n\nMD5/SHA for FASTQ, BAM, VCF/gVCF, coverage/QC files\n\n\n\nRecommended analysis software\n\nFranklin\nTODO\n\nRecommended labs\nLabs to avoid\n\nThere are group of online DTC labs that are often scammy, with unclear and sometimes outrageous delays, inaccuracies due to poor methodology, or simply because they only accept saliva samples as they are not local and this in itself can cause inaccuracies.\n\n\nDante\nSequencing\nTODO\n\nSome anecdotes:\n\nTODO: cite anecdotes on inaccuracies/delays/scams of these labs\n\nSample email (generated by GPT based on these notes)\n\nNOTE: Don’t forget to change the bracketed [fields]!\n\n\n30x WGS — technical parameters &amp; deliverables (quote + ETA)\n\nDear [Lab],\n\nProject: 30x human WGS (rare-variant discovery; analysis in Franklin; option to rerun later).  \nPlease confirm what you can provide, list available options where noted, and send quote + ETA.
