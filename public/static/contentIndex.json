Only established advice is included here. If you know me, ask for prescription-free sources I can‚Äôt list publicly.\nPreface\nOn risk ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of a Russian roulette\n\nCOVID hasn‚Äôt gone away: almost everyone gets infected 1-3x/year, many develop LC (5%, up to 30% have some damage even after mild infx)\nNot like a normal virus, need to adjust priors:\n\nThe more often you catch it, the more immunocompromised you will be, as opposed to training your immune system.\nMany had a few, probably mild infections before developing LC. For me it was the 3rd or 4th.\n\n\nThreat model is not intuitive:\n\nMild acute infection ‚â† low LC risk! Mine was mild too.\nYou don‚Äôt have to be traditionally ‚Äúat risk‚Äù (obesity, diabetes, old age) to develop LC.\nLC risk grows linearly with number of infx\n\n\nNO CURE FOR LC\n\nBuy the things now, don‚Äôt leave it for the last moment.\n\nGoal: detect an infection early and aggressively reduce viral load ASAP.\n\nAnything less will greatly increase your LC risk.\nRemember: significant latency in suspecting exposure ‚Üí testing positive ‚Üí getting your doctor to prescribe the drugs here (or worse, waiting for delivery) ‚Üí starting dosing. This makes or breaks your protocol.\n\n\nSmall investment, but avoiding losing your life (not being able to get out of bed for years, like the most severe patients) or losing 2SD FSIQ (happened to me and other formerly outlier IQ people I know) is worth a few grand.\n\nThink of this as insurance/hedging.\n\n\nMake friends with your doctor so he can prescribe you what you want.\nMake a traveling kit as travels are high risk for infection.\nTest all the medicine listed here at least once (separately) to make sure you tolerate them.\nCosts (estimate):\n\none time: ‚Ç¨500-1000 (air purifier, testing equipment)\nmonthly: $200 (supplements, masks)\nper infx: ‚Ç¨200-1500 (depending on choices)\n\n\n\nInfection prevention:\n\nnasal + oral sprays before/after socializing/exposure:\n\n\n\nThis is the bare minimum you should do, especially when you cannot mask. Even the best masks are not perfect, every layer of protection reduces your chances of infection.\n\n\nnasal:\n\nNO (nitric oxide) based - SaNOtize formula:  EU ‚Ç¨17\n\n\n\nNote that the product name varies by region (Enovid, Virx, etc). See **distributors **.\n\n\n\n\nor astrodimer sodium based: EU ‚Ç¨10\n\n\n\nA direct virucidal, may be less irritating than NO or carrageenan based sprays, which is recommended for people already chronically ill (e.g. with LC).\n\n\n\n\nor HPMC based\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9969373/\n\n\n\nNitric oxide nasal spray (NONS) from SaNOtize has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 viral loads in clinical trials. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) nasal sprays like Taffix from Nasus Pharma have also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\noral:\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nmasking:\n\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to wear a mask at all times (understandable), infection risk is likely Pareto distributed and most of it happens in transmission hubs: hospitals, clinics, flights, airports, schools, taxi, public transport, grocery shopping (anywhere people have/want to go even if sick; very few people go to gym when sick). You could mask in these places and otherwise not.\n\n\nN95/FFP2 mask or better (ideally FFP3): 3M Aura 1873V+, 3M Aura 9332+, or other 3M Aura with head straps (not earloops)\nVitacore CAN99 9500 or similar for MRI (most masks have metal components)\nlist of reliable sources\n\n\nsupplements:\n\nantiviral (3CLpro inhibitor):\n\nsumac (effective for price): maybe drink it as a ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù as eating it is harsh pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9729036/\nrhamnan sulfates: pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8707894/\n\nJapanese seaweeds (cheap): Monostroma nitidum or Ulva pertusa based only (red seaweeds won‚Äôt work)\nor Arterosil (expensive but has other benefits) ‚Äì EU ‚Ç¨85/month\n\n\ngreen tea (EGCG): * pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919953/\n\nalso most polyphenols, especially with a gallate group\n\n\n\n\nnattokinase/serraptase: binds and degrades spike protein, degrades biofilm where viral reservoirs can form, and busts plaque that can worsen COVID cardiovascular issues ‚Äì global\nalpha-lipoic-acid (ALA) ‚Äì Na-R-ALA/BioEnhanced formula: improves microvasculature and immune defenses, against COVID &amp; flu A ‚Äì global US\nbasics: zinc, basic vitamins &amp; especially C/B/D, magnesium, omega-3 (only get pharma grade ethyl-ester form, eg Lovaza/Omacor), etc\n\n\n\nüí° Deficiencies in general as well as a poor gut biome make one perdisposed to chronic illness and so also LC.\n\n\n\n\n[optional] may have some basic effect: selenium, NAC, CBD, black cumin seeds/black seed oil, curcumin, garlic, ginger, pomegranate\n\n\ntesting:\n\n\n\nüí° You want a test with high sensitivity (correctly captures positive results) and high specificity (correctly identifies negatives).\n\n\n[best] at home with PlusLife (98.91%/100%) ‚Äì EU ‚Ç¨260 + ‚Ç¨6/test\n\n\n\nThis ends up being the cheapest option long term, especially if you have a family.

Wear a mask when going into their room.\n\n\n\n\nüí° The easiest way to reduce risk of your child getting infected in school (major transmission hub) is to donate a few high CFM HEPA air purifiers to their classroom.\n\n\n\n\nüí° Aim for &lt;700ppm CO2 concentration indoors (outdoor baseline: ~400ppm), as higher concentrations indicate poor circulation and so more viral particles in air.\n\n\n\n\nCO2 monitors:\n\n[best] Aranet4 ‚Äì ‚Ç¨180\n[alternative]: AirFanta G2 Air Quality Monitor ‚Äì $100\n\n\nair purifiers w/ HEPA filters:\n\ndo NOT get ozone/ionizers ‚Üí carcinogenic\nCFM (cubic feet per meter): only relevant metric, higher=better; can also use multiple small devices in a large room\n[best]: AirFanta 3Pro: aesthetics might be a problem ‚Äì ‚Ç¨180\n\nyou can DYI build this too, google Corsi-Rosenthal\n\n\n[expensive/alternative]: Coway AirMega: looks better but much more expensive ‚Äì ‚Ç¨500\n\n\nmore info: main autist in this domain (also good)\n\n\nmasking + antivirals &gt; vaccines:\n\n\n\nI don‚Äôt think the vax risk/reward is worth it, definitely isn‚Äôt with mRNA, due to design (eg if mRNA lipid particles circulate to heart or other sensitive areas and create RNA factories in those cells) and quality control (QC) issues, and while Novavax is better, you‚Äôre still injecting spike proteins that cause half the issues in LC, and if the QC is as poor with Novavax as with Pfizer, those spikes may not be properly neutralized.

The former uses a larger needle (between 25G and 27G, possibly larger ones too) and can be either modular or a simple non-modular unit, while the ones for injecting should be modular so you can attach a filter and a thinner needle (29G or 30G).\n\n\n\n\nFor modular syringes, there are two connection types: luer slip/taper and luer lock.

I also find IM to be more comfortable than subQ (the stomach pinning sucks), so I would simply always default to IM for every peptide.\n\n\n\n\nif you may faint from needles, sit down on couch where you can recline afterwards\nwipe injection site (use different wipe): ‚ö†Ô∏è use circular motion moving outward for 15-30s\nwait a little for injection site to dry, this avoids stinging\ninject:\n\nrelax and don‚Äôt move or contract muscle during injection\ninject straight on (perpendicular to skin)\nmake sure you push in needle fully, inject everything\n\n\nwipe place of injection again\nwipe vial tops again and put in fridge\n\n\nIf you need a visual guide, this video from the 17 minute mark is good.\n\nNotes on injecting multiple peptides, IMPORTANT\n\nalways use a different syringe and needle for each peptide\nideally you inject into different locations or wait some time between each peptide injection\n\n\nPeptides overview\n\nSS-31/elamipretide: mitochondrial antioxidant\nBPC-157: tissue repair, gut barrier repair\nTB-4/TB-500: immune/glial modulator, vascular (VEGF), antioxidant\nMOTS-C: mitochondria, AMPK, skeletal muscle glucose metabolism\nhumanin: mitochondria, cellular stress pathway\nmelanotan: skin tanning, sexual function\ncerebrolysin: promotes neurotrophic stimulation\nKPV: kill candida, repair gut lining\nLA: temporary barrier sealant\n\n\nAdditional reading and sources\n\nx.com/0xVM7 shared a lot of the knowledge in this document\nanother guide by someone I trust, but long winded and incomplete\n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"content/index.md","title":"The BioThumos Knowledge Base","links":["Chronic-Illness/covid-protocol","Peptide/guide"],"tags":[],"content":"This is a collection of knowledge on COVID, Long COVID, ME/CFS, health optimization, longevity, and other related topics based on latest research and anecdotes.\nSee all knowledge entries in the left sidebar.\nHighlights\n\nLong COVID Prevention Protocol\nPeptide Guide\n\nContributors\n\nZagreus - The main author.
