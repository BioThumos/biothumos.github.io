Only established advice is included here. If you know me, ask for prescription-free sources I can‚Äôt list publicly.\nPreface\nOn risk ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of a Russian roulette\n\nCOVID hasn‚Äôt gone away: almost everyone gets infected 1-3x/year, many develop LC (5%, up to 30% have some damage even after mild infx)\nNot like a normal virus, need to adjust priors:\n\nThe more often you catch it, the more immunocompromised you will be, as opposed to training your immune system.\nMany had a few, probably mild infections before developing LC. For me it was the 3rd or 4th.\n\n\nThreat model is not intuitive:\n\nMild acute infection ‚â† low LC risk! Mine was mild too.\nYou don‚Äôt have to be traditionally ‚Äúat risk‚Äù (obesity, diabetes, old age) to develop LC.\nLC risk grows linearly with number of infx\n\n\nNO CURE FOR LC\n\nBuy the things now, don‚Äôt leave it for the last moment.\n\nGoal: detect an infection early and aggressively reduce viral load ASAP.\n\nAnything less will greatly increase your LC risk.\nRemember: significant latency in suspecting exposure ‚Üí testing positive ‚Üí getting your doctor to prescribe the drugs here (or worse, waiting for delivery) ‚Üí starting dosing. This makes or breaks your protocol.\n\n\nSmall investment, but avoiding losing your life (not being able to get out of bed for years, like the most severe patients) or losing 2SD FSIQ (happened to me and other formerly outlier IQ people I know) is worth a few grand.\n\nThink of this as insurance/hedging.\n\n\nMake friends with your doctor so he can prescribe you what you want.\nMake a traveling kit as travels are high risk for infection.\nTest all the medicine listed here at least once (separately) to make sure you tolerate them.\nCosts (estimate):\n\none time: ‚Ç¨500-1000 (air purifier, testing equipment)\nmonthly: $200 (supplements, masks)\nper infx: ‚Ç¨200-1500 (depending on choices)\n\n\n\nInfection prevention\nNasal + oral sprays before/after socializing/exposure\n\n\n\nThis is the bare minimum you should do, especially when you cannot mask. Even the best masks are not perfect, every layer of protection reduces your chances of infection.\n\n\nnasal:\n\nNO (nitric oxide) based - SaNOtize formula:  EU ‚Ç¨17\n\n\n\nNote that the product name varies by region (Enovid, Virx, etc). See **distributors **.\n\n\n\n\nor astrodimer sodium based: EU ‚Ç¨10\n\n\n\nA direct virucidal, may be less irritating than NO or carrageenan based sprays, which is recommended for people already chronically ill (e.g. with LC).\n\n\n\n\nor HPMC based\npmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9969373/\n\n\n\nNitric oxide nasal spray (NONS) from SaNOtize has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 viral loads in clinical trials. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) nasal sprays like Taffix from Nasus Pharma have also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\noral:\n\nTODO\n\n\n\nMasking\n\n\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to wear a mask at all times (understandable), infection risk is likely Pareto distributed and most of it happens in transmission hubs: hospitals, clinics, flights, airports, schools, taxi, public transport, grocery shopping (anywhere people have/want to go even if sick; very few people go to gym when sick). You could mask in these places and otherwise not.\n\n\nN95/FFP2 mask or better (ideally FFP3): 3M Aura 1873V+, 3M Aura 9332+, or other 3M Aura with head straps (not earloops)\nVitacore CAN99 9500 or similar for MRI (most masks have metal components)\nlist of reliable sources\n\nSupplements\n\nantiviral (3CLpro inhibitor):\n\nsumac (effective for price): maybe drink it as a ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù as eating it is harsh pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9729036/\nrhamnan sulfates: pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8707894/\n\nJapanese seaweeds (cheap): Monostroma nitidum or Ulva pertusa based only (red seaweeds won‚Äôt work)\nor Arterosil (expensive but has other benefits) ‚Äì EU ‚Ç¨85/month\n\n\ngreen tea (EGCG): * pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919953/\n\nalso most polyphenols, especially with a gallate group\n\n\n\n\nnattokinase/serraptase: binds and degrades spike protein, degrades biofilm where viral reservoirs can form, and busts plaque that can worsen COVID cardiovascular issues ‚Äì global\nalpha-lipoic-acid (ALA) ‚Äì Na-R-ALA/BioEnhanced formula: improves microvasculature and immune defenses, against COVID &amp; flu A ‚Äì global US\nbasics: zinc, basic vitamins &amp; especially C/B/D, magnesium, omega-3 (only get pharma grade ethyl-ester form, eg Lovaza/Omacor), etc\n\n\n\nüí° Deficiencies in general as well as a poor gut biome make one perdisposed to chronic illness and so also LC.\n\n\n\n\n[optional] may have some basic effect: selenium, NAC, CBD, black cumin seeds/black seed oil, curcumin, garlic, ginger, pomegranate\n\nTesting\n\n\n\nüí° You want a test with high sensitivity (correctly captures positive results) and high specificity (correctly identifies negatives).\n\n\n[best] at home with PlusLife (98.91%/100%) ‚Äì EU ‚Ç¨260 + ‚Ç¨6/test\n\n\n\nThis ends up being the cheapest option long term, especially if you have a family.

The former uses a larger needle (27G) and can be either modular or a simple non-modular unit, while the ones for injecting should be modular so you can attach a filter and a thinner needle (29G or 30G).\n\n\n\n\nFor modular syringes, there are two connection types: luer slip/taper and luer lock. Latter is preferred as it‚Äôs more secure.\n\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Only buy pharma-grade components, meaning they must be: sterile (individually packaged), depyrogenized, non-toxic, non-latex (some are allergic to it), non-PVC, non-DEHP, &amp; ISO 13485 compliant.\n\n\n\nsyringe: 1cc/ml 100U luer lock: UK\n\n\n\n‚ÄòU‚Äô stands for units, and you want it to be 100 to make dosing precise and easy. 100U should be 1ml.\n\n\n\n\nIf 1cc syringes are more expensive than alternatives, like in my case, you can get 2-3cc syringes for mixing to save some money, as mixing needs less accuracy (usually increments of 1ml are used), while 1cc 100U is more important for injecting as smaller doses are injected (5-10U).\n\n\n\n\n\nneedles:\n\n\n\n‚ÄòG‚Äô stands for gauge, i.e. the diameter.\n\n\npinning needle: has to be thin, 29-30G 1/2‚Äù luer lock: UK\n\nif you have thick fat layer under skin, may want a longer needle\nideally low dead space for pinning needles (only important to save substance, not a requirement)\n\n\nfor reconstitution: you can use a thicker needle if it‚Äôs cheaper: e.g. 27G 3/4-1‚Äù luer lock: UK\n\n[alternative] one-piece or pre-assembled luer insulin syringe for reconstitution, can be cheaper\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\nmost guides don‚Äôt mention this, but IMO it‚Äôs a must: rationale\n\nprotein aggregates may form that can cause an unwanted immune reaction\nthere can be contaminants\n\n\n\n\nI would use a filter with every injection. This makes it more expensive, but it lowers risk. You could also filter once during reconstitution into a sterile vial, but I couldn‚Äôt find sterile sealed pharma-grade empty vials in my region (don‚Äôt trust Amazon). US\n\n\n\n\nMany inject without filters and are fine, but you probably don‚Äôt want to tempt fate.\n\n\n\n\nPurity ratings are always after filtering!!! E.g. Janoshik for sure always tests with 0.22 Œºm filters. This means CoA does not pick up degradation of actives due to protein aggregates at all.\n\n\nmembrane material:\n\nhydrophilic: to allow. water flow\n\n(if you are injecting oils, not covered here, must be oleophilic/hydrophobic)\n\n\n[best] PES: preferred, lowest protein binding capacity\n\n\n\nLow protein binding capacity is important to not waste your peptides.\n\n\nCN/global DE\n\n\n[alternative] PVDF-L: slightly higher protein binding capacity\nAVOID: PVDF-H, PTFE, nylon or cellulose acetate\n\n\n\nThese have high protein binding capacity or are hydrophilic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2 Œºm (or 0.22 Œºm) filters are best for sterility &amp;
