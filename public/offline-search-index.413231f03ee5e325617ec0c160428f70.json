Most peptides are not bioavailable orally and have little bioavailability sublingually, so unfortunately you will have to inject if you want the full benefits. This guide focuses on IM (intramuscular) or subQ (subcutaneous) injections.\nSources Peptides are a legal grey area. Very few of them have been authorized for human use by health agencies (one example is Zadaxin – TA1), yet all of them are sold for “research use” – and that is how you can buy them. All sources will tell you their compounds are not for human consumption, which they do to stay legally compliant, but it is also why you have to make absolutely sure the ones you buy have third-party purity and content testing.\n3 types of sources: pharma: purest, due to stricter guidelines, very expensive, hard to get main difference: purified to remove endotoxins UGL labs don’t even test for endotoxins, 99% purity labels don’t cover this. This is a risk-cost trade-off that you have to make.\nUGL (underground lab): cheapest and often also purest can be 5-10x cheaper than research peptides best way to find UGLs is by browsing Meso and checking comments This forum is notable because it is public and has many active users who often independently test and evaluate sources, so scammers get filtered out very quickly.\nChinese UGLs have the cheapest peptides, bar none, and many are legitimate businesses. Only order from sources tested at janosh and with many customers.\nresearch: more expensive than UGLs, cheaper than pharma not necessarily purer than UGLs may get it through customs screening easier than unlabeled vials with white powder from China ⚠️ Only use 99% purity sources with many customers and a good reputation (esp. if going for UGL). Unless you can get pharma peptides e.g. in Russia,\ntesting gold standard: https://janoshik.com/ If you see a vendor frequently testing their batches with janoshik, it’s probably trustworthy.\nobviously not relevant for pharma peptides always ask for third-party testing and CoA’s (certificate of authenticity) ⚠️ Disreputable labs do in-house testing and cook results.\nsome vetted sources: EU: https://biolabshop.eu/ - $$ research 97-99% purity, so I mostly avoid their injectables I use their KPV and LA caps as slight impurity is less important when taken orally UK: https://pharmalabglobal.com - $$$ research recommended by a pharma engineer friend I trust US: https://www.peptidesciences.com/ - $$$ research, but possibly purer than others If you know me, ask me for my latest UGL sources. I don’t want to list them here in case this document becomes popular and attracts unwanted attention.\ndubious sources: CN: https://nexaph.com/ - $ UGL used by some twitter mutuals but some concerns on contaminants and cherry picking tests, and an overview has recent janoshik reports likely a drop-shipper that reships other cheaper UGLs Legality in some countries using experimental compounds for personal use, even steroids, is fine (e.g. UK), in others they are strictly regulated prepare before making any purchases: check your local laws, read forum posts for anecdotes, ask experts if still unsure: order small quantities each time, less suspicious during customs screening higher shipping fees but given how cheap UGL sources are it’s not a major concern China UGL sources usually ship with innocent labels (e.g. “hyaluronic acid”), so chances are there won’t be a problem ask to make sure they do this if it’s a concern All the things you will need to buy Bacteriostatic (BAC) water ⚠️ Do not use regular water or even sterile water. BAC is needed to keep bacteria out, sterile won’t do. Even BAC is not a foolproof solution, but it greatly reduces risk.\nComponents must meet USP specs. BAC also meets a specific pH range suitable for peptides, others may damage it. Even the vial materials need to be specific not to change the pH much, which is why I recommend Hospira below.\n⚠️ do NOT buy BAC from Amazon, see why [best] Hospira/Pfizer: Very hard to get as it’s an rx product usually only available to licensed suppliers, even though it’s “just” water.\nwhy it’s superior licensed medical suppliers that sell w/o rx: US - currently the only one US source but comes out to $7-8/vial with shipping and customs, while EU sources are usually $20-30/vial (example) it’s a no-brainer in the US at $4/vial ⚠️ There are many shady sites asking for 3-10x this price or straight up selling fakes, which could be very dangerous to inject. This is not an area where you want to penny-pinch.\n[alternative] your peptide source may have purity tested BAC for a similar price or cheaper $2.5/10ml is common with Chinese sources [advanced] DIY: pharma-grade 50-100ml sterile water in vials - DE pharma-grade benzyl-alcohol, usually comes in 0.5-1L size for €70 and will last you a lifetime - DE needs to be: “Endotoxin Free” or “For Parenteral Applications” (Parenteral=for injection) use a syringe to get 0.9% of BA into the steril water guide, additional info Syringes The idea is to use two types of syringes: one for reconstituting (mixing) the peptide, another for injection. The former uses a larger needle (between 25G and 27G, possibly larger ones too) and can be either modular or a simple non-modular unit, while the ones for injecting should be modular so you can attach a filter and a thinner needle (29G or 30G).\nSlang: slin=insulin, pinning=injecting, drawing=reconstituting\nFor modular syringes, there are two connection types: luer slip/taper and luer lock. Latter is preferred as it’s more secure.\n⚠️ Only buy pharma-grade components, meaning they must be: sterile (individually packaged), depyrogenized, non-toxic, non-latex (some are allergic to it), non-PVC, non-DEHP, \u0026 ISO 13485 compliant.\nsyringe: 1cc/ml 100U luer lock: UK ‘U’ stands for units, and you want it to be 100 to make dosing precise and easy.\nIf 1cc syringes are more expensive than alternatives, like in my case, you can get 2-3cc needles for mixing to save some money, as mixing needs less accuracy (usually increments of 1ml are used), while 1cc 100U is more important for injecting as smaller doses are injected (5-10U).\ndrawing needle (for reconstitution): 25-27G 3/4-1\" luer lock: UK ‘G’ stands for gauge, i.e. the diameter.\nideally low dead space [alternative] one-piece or pre-assembled luer insulin syringe, cheaper pinning needle (for injections): 29-30G 1/2\" luer lock: UK ideally low dead space if you have thick fat layer under skin, may want a longer needle Filters most guides don’t mention this, but it’s A MUST: rationale protein aggregates may form that can cause an unwanted immune reaction there can be contaminants I would use a filter with every injection. This makes it more expensive, but it lowers risk. You could also filter once during reconstitution into a sterile vial, but I couldn’t find sterile sealed pharma-grade empty vials (don’t trust Amazon). US\nMany inject without filters and are fine, but you probably don’t want to tempt fate.\nmembrane material: hydrophilic: to allow. water flow (if you are injecting oils, not covered here, must be oleophilic/hydrophobic) [best] PES: preferred, lowest protein binding capacity Low protein binding capacity is important to not waste your peptides.\nCN/global DE [alternative] PVDF-L: slightly higher protein binding capacity AVOID: PVDF-H, PTFE, nylon or cellulose acetate These have high protein binding capacity or are hydrophilic.\n0.2 μm (or 0.22 μm) filters are best for sterility \u0026 removing protein aggregates without damaging the peptide structure Et cetera opaque box: to store peptides (both raw and mixed) shielded from light alcohol wipes: to disinfect the exterior of vials before reconstitution and skin before injecting mirror: for injecting [maybe] electronic pH meter only if you mix special peptides Storage BAC: unopened: practically good forever despite expiry date away from light in room temperature, as alcohol may separate from water in the fridge opened/after use: 28 days in fridge Recommended to get volume of BAC that you use up with each reconstituting so no there is no left-over that could spoil or that you’d have to waste.\npeptides: in fridge freezer not needed: might damage molecules upon unthawing most consumer freezers cycle between low-high temperatures that may damage peptide in opaque box, away from light disinfect box with alcohol wipes before putting in peptides shelf life: raw: always ask source but should last 6 months in fridge mixed: 28 days Mixing (reconstituting) uncap BAC and peptide vials wipe vial tops w/ alcohol wipes pick new syringe w/ drawing needle (25-27G) if luer-lock: attach do NOT touch needle (use protective case while assembling) remove air from syringe TODO link video draw BAC water to desired concentration draw upside down refer to guide below on calculating desired concentration inject water into dial, NOTE: ⚠️ DO NOT SPRAY water directly on peptide as it MAY DAMAGE IT let it drip SLOWLY down the side of the vial onto ONE SPOT OF THE POWDER, not everywhere don’t need to push, vacuum in vial will suck water into the vial after injecting water, draw equivalent air from the peptide to neutralize pressure, then remove needle gently roll the vial ⚠️ DO NOT SHAKE (may damage) let mix normally and do nothing, may take a while it is now reconstituted TODO: min volume of water for solution\nHow to calculate concentrations note down the vial content eg: 10mg take your desired minimum dose eg: 500mcg=0.5mg calculate dose ratio: dose/vial eg: 0.5/10=0.05=5% note down BAC volume used for mixing eg: 2ml=200U calculate injection volume: multiply ratio with BAC volume eg: 0.05*200U=10U this means you would draw 10U=0.1ml worth of mixed peptide into your 1cc injection syringe ⚠️ choose BAC volume such that the minimum injection volume is 5U=0.05ml anything smaller will be very hard to precisely dose pH most peptides can be mixed with BAC (pH=[5,7]) some compounds like NAD+ require careful pH adjustments TODO Injecting remove mixed peptide vial from fridge 10 minutes before injection use new syringe every time, w/ pinning needle (29-30G) attach filter to syringe, then attach the pinning needle to filter remove excess air from syringe air bubbles: mini bubbles aren’t dangerous, you can inject up to 1cc of air safely (but obviously don’t do that) wipe mixed peptide vial, uncap, wipe vial top draw mixed peptide upside down choose injection location IM locations: delts preferred, glutes guide subQ also works but likely a bit less effective need to roll skin into 1-inch fold of skin and inject there see this guide if you may faint from needles, sit down on couch where you can recline wipe injection site (use different wipe): use circular motion moving outward wait a little for injection site to dry, this avoids stinging inject: relax and don’t move or contract muscle during injection inject straight on (perpendicular to skin) make sure you push in needle fully, inject everything wipe place of injection again wipe vial tops again and put in fridge If you need a visual guide, this video from the 17 minute mark is good.\nNotes on injecting multiple peptides, IMPORTANT always use a different syringe and needle for each peptide ideally you inject into different locations or wait some time between each peptide injection Peptides overview SS31/elamipretide: mitochondrial antioxidant BPC157: tissue repair, gut barrier repair TB4/TB500: immune/glial modulator, vascular (VEGF), antioxidant MOTS-C: mitochondria, AMPK, skeletal muscle glucose metabolism humanin: mitochondria, cellular stress pathway melanotan: skin tanning, sexual function cerebrolysin: promotes neurotrophic stimulation KPV: kill candida, repair barrier LA: temporary barrier sealant Additional reading and sources https://x.com/0xVM7 – a good friend who has shared a lot of the knowledge in this document another guide by someone I trust, but it’s a bit long winded and incomplete IMO

Will keep up to date. Only established advice is included here. If you know me, ask for prescription-free sources I can’t list publicly.\nPreface On risk – it’s kind of a Russian roulette COVID hasn’t gone away: almost everyone gets infected 1-3x/year, many develop LC (5%, up to 30% have some damage even after mild infx) Not like a normal virus, need to adjust priors: The more often you catch it, the more immunocompromised you will be, as opposed to training your immune system. Many had a few, probably mild infections before developing LC. For me it was the 3rd or 4th. Threat model is not intuitive: Mild acute infection ≠ low LC risk! Mine was mild too. You don’t have to be traditionally “at risk” (obesity, diabetes, old age) to develop LC. LC risk grows linearly with number of infx NO CURE FOR LC Buy the things now, don’t leave it for the last moment. Goal: detect an infection early and aggressively reduce viral load ASAP. Anything less will greatly increase your LC risk. Remember: significant latency in suspecting exposure → testing positive → getting your doctor to prescribe the drugs here (or worse, waiting for delivery) → starting dosing. This makes or breaks your protocol. Small investment, but avoiding losing your life (not being able to get out of bed for years, like the most severe patients) or losing 2SD FSIQ (happened to me and other formerly outlier IQ people I know) is worth a few grand. Think of this as insurance/hedging. Make friends with your doctor so he can prescribe you what you want. Make a traveling kit as travels are high risk for infection. Test all the medicine listed here at least once (separately) to make sure you tolerate them. Costs (estimate): one time: €500-1000 (air purifier, testing equipment) monthly: $200 (supplements, masks) per infx: €200-1500 (depending on choices) Infection prevention nasal + oral sprays before/after socializing/exposure: This is the bare minimum you should do, especially when you cannot mask. Even the best masks are not perfect, every layer of protection reduces your chances of infection.\nnasal: NO (nitric oxide) based - SaNOtize formula: EU €17 Note that the product name varies by region (Enovid, Virx, etc). See **distributors **.\nor astrodimer sodium based: EU €10 A direct virucidal, may be less irritating than NO or carrageenan based sprays, which is recommended for people already chronically ill (e.g. with LC).\nor HPMC based https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9969373/ Nitric oxide nasal spray (NONS) from SaNOtize has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 viral loads in clinical trials. Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) nasal sprays like Taffix from Nasus Pharma have also demonstrated effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission\noral: TODO masking: If you don’t want to wear a mask at all times (understandable), infection risk is likely Pareto distributed and most of it happens in transmission hubs: hospitals, clinics, flights, airports, schools, taxi, public transport, grocery shopping (anywhere people have/want to go even if sick; very few people go to gym when sick). You could mask in these places and otherwise not.\nN95/FFP2 mask or better (ideally FFP3): 3M Aura 1873V+, 3M Aura 9332+, or other 3M Aura with head straps (not earloops) Vitacore CAN99 9500 or similar for MRI (most masks have metal components) list of reliable sources supplements: antiviral (3CLpro inhibitor): sumac (effective for price): maybe drink it as a “cocktail” as eating it is harsh https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9729036/ rhamnan sulfates: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8707894/ Japanese seaweeds (cheap): Monostroma nitidum or Ulva pertusa based only (red seaweeds won’t work) or Arterosil (expensive but has other benefits) – EU €85/month green tea (EGCG): * https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8919953/ also most polyphenols, especially with a gallate group nattokinase/serraptase: binds and degrades spike protein, degrades biofilm where viral reservoirs can form, and busts plaque that can worsen COVID cardiovascular issues – global alpha-lipoic-acid (ALA) – Na-R-ALA/BioEnhanced formula: improves microvasculature and immune defenses, against COVID \u0026 flu A – global US basics: zinc, basic vitamins \u0026 especially C/B/D, magnesium, omega-3 (only get pharma grade ethyl-ester form, eg Lovaza/Omacor), etc 💡 Deficiencies in general as well as a poor gut biome make one perdisposed to chronic illness and so also LC.\n[optional] may have some basic effect: selenium, NAC, CBD, black cumin seeds/black seed oil, curcumin, garlic, ginger, pomegranate testing: 💡 You want a test with high sensitivity (correctly captures positive results) and high specificity (correctly identifies negatives).\n[best] at home with PlusLife (98.91%/100%) – EU €260 + €6/test This ends up being the cheapest option long term, especially if you have a family. If you travel a lot, work with people, or have school children, this is worth the investment.\n[alternative] Metrix is similar to PlusLife, tests are more expensive though [alternative] get a PCR done at a lab, you can usually pay a little extra for express results rapid antigen tests (RATs) are probably no longer viable Anecdotally, they don’t seem to detect newer variants, it’s unclear why.\nsoap (not alcohol) hand washing air quality: COVID is airborne, so maintaining good air quality is important for your home when you have guests over or a family member is sick, your office, your children’s classrooms, etc 💡 If you have a family, understanding airflow is important when dealing with infections – one person can be sick, but as long as they have negative air pressure in their room and positive pressure everywhere else, virus won’t escape their room and infect everyone else. Eg: fans/HEPA filters/open windows in hallway with airflow pointing towards the sick person’s room, fan in room directing air towards window. Wear a mask when going into their room.\n💡 The easiest way to reduce risk of your child getting infected in school (major transmission hub) is to donate a few high CFM HEPA air purifiers to their classroom.\n💡 Aim for \u003c700ppm CO2 concentration indoors (outdoor baseline: ~400ppm), as higher concentrations indicate poor circulation and so more viral particles in air.\nCO2 monitors: [best] Aranet4 – €180 [alternative]: AirFanta G2 Air Quality Monitor – $100 air purifiers w/ HEPA filters: do NOT get ozone/ionizers → carcinogenic CFM (cubic feet per meter): only relevant metric, higher=better; can also use multiple small devices in a large room [best]: AirFanta 3Pro: aesthetics might be a problem – €180 you can DYI build this too, google Corsi-Rosenthal [expensive/alternative]: Coway AirMega: looks better but much more expensive – €500 more info: main autist in this domain (also good) masking + antivirals \u003e vaccines: I don’t think the vax risk/reward is worth it, definitely isn’t with mRNA, due to design (eg if mRNA lipid particles circulate to heart or other sensitive areas and create RNA factories in those cells) and quality control (QC) issues, and while Novavax is better, you’re still injecting spike proteins that cause half the issues in LC, and if the QC is as poor with Novavax as with Pfizer, those spikes may not be properly neutralized. I can’t tell, inject at own risk.\nC19 mutates rapidly → vaccines quickly become ineffective → require regular shots every few months → increased Long Vax risk (law of large numbers) [advanced] monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) – $1500: more effective and seemingly less risky than vaccines effective protection for 6 months, can repeat there are always new versions to tackle the latest variant latest Sipavibart Acute stage treatment ⚠️ Follow these steps as soon as you notice first symptoms, before waiting for a positive test.\nOutline: double key supplement doses high dose famotidine test → if positive, continue choose based on budget and tolerance: (a) antiviral – $1200 [preferred] ensitrelvir or paxlovid [optional] reduce famotidine dose after 2-3 days: immune modulator (b) metformin – dirt cheap (c) TA1 – $150 [advanced] In detail: ⚠️ Timing is important. Please read carefully.\ndouble vitamin C/D/B, zinc, omega-3 dosage (C - up to 2g/day) increase vitamin D to 50k IU https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39072958/ take high dose famotidine: 3x80mg/day start immediately upon first symptom presentation used to prime an early immune response 💡 COVID delays immune activation in your body for maximum proliferation, after which a delayed disproportionate immune activation occurs – too little, then too much.\neffectively reduces viral load at high doses ⚠️ if you have low stomach acid: drink sth acidic to compensate test (PlusLife or similar) → if positive, continue 💡 The idea here is that while you don’t know if you have COVID, by taking the cheap famotidine first, you hedge without wasting the hard to source antivirals (they’re also expensive).\nchoose based on budget and tolerance: (a) antiviral – $1200 [preferred] This is my preferred stack, but it’s also the most expensive, so it may not apply to everyone.\nstart an antiviral (3CLpro inhibitor): start as soon as you get a positive test used to reduce viral load of already infected cells, preventing further proliferation 💡 Most hospitals use a single course, which is absolutely not sufficient even for not “at risk” people.\n[best] ensitrelvir: 2 courses (14 days) ~€1000 Japanese antiviral that is better than paxlovid, hard to get and expensive import from Japan to UK/US only (use forwarding service) If you order once, you can ask for a 10% discount on your next order. You could get the 7-pill dose first and then the 28-pill one next with 10% off.\ndoesn’t require a prescription [alternative] paxlovid: 2 courses (10 days) $100 or ~$1100 less effective but likely still beneficial, if you can afford it can get it anywhere with a prescription without prescription: you can order Skyvira, the Russian equivalent, from some Russian pharma sites TODO alternatively try indiamart: very cheap but I personally don’t trust Indians (FDA found purity concerns with some drugs years ago); they’re also likely to scam you, so ideally ask friends for trusted sources including prices ⚠️ if you have stomach issues, reduce famotidine dose after a day or two into ensitrelvir (the two may enhance each other) to 3x40-60mg/day wait 2-3 days and start an immune modulator: 💡 The main danger with COVID is not the virus itself, but either or both the immune suppression it causes (which can lead to reactivated latent infections, such as herpes or Lyme), or the exacerbated immune response your body may mount against it, which can lead to immune exhaustion, which partially explains LC. We need to tame excessive immune activation without suppression.\n[preferred] bitter melon (supplement): 2-8g/day best/also good/or this a slightly weaker AMPK activator, like metformin [alternative] low dose metformin (prescription): 1-2x500mg/day if you have metformin, which is much cheaper than high-quality supplements, you could use a low dose Low quality supplements are a waste of money.\n[advanced/alternative] TA1 peptide – see choice (c) below for details 💡 The idea of using weaker or smaller dose immune modulators here is that with famotidine \u0026 antivirals effectively targeting viral spread and infected cells, respectively, inflammation should not be as much.\n(b) metformin – very cheap 💡 Due to a lack of antivirals to target infected cells, we assume inflammation is high, so metformin – which is a potent anti-inflammatory – is used.\nstart as soon as you get a positive test requires a prescription titrate: 500mg on day 1, 500mg twice daily on days 2–5, then 500mg in the morning and 1000mg in the evening up to day 14 ~40% reduction of LC incidence (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(21)00138-1/fulltext \u0026 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00299-2/fulltext) (c) Thymosin Alpha 1 (TA1) – $150 [advanced] ⚠️ This step is only recommended if you have experience with peptides, therefore I’m not going into too much detail here.\nyou can start this upon first symptom presentation, as it’s useful even if it’s not COVID immune modulator: if too little immune activation → increases it; if too much → lowers it if you don’t like subcutaneous (subQ) injections: try Thymogen oral capsules, which are not as effective as subQ but still good and far less hassle otherwise use your favorite source (or feel free to ask) to get the subQ TA1 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8366398 and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10030336/ Experimental The above should be enough to get you there most of the way, but if you really want to be sure, add these to your protocol. high-dose melatonin: No enough clinical trials on this but it’s harmless enough with big potential upside that I’m including it. Dorris Loh (author of protocol) claims this is sufficient but given the experimental nature of it, I’d do the other things in this document to be sure. A friend followed this protocol and made symptoms disappear in 10-12h multiple times. KEY: Start as soon as first symptoms present! Otherwise it doesn’t work well. instructions theory: prevents virus from forming factories in the cell, preserves mitochondria, prevents modification of RNA molecules in the cell Some interventions that didn’t make the cut ivermectin/IVM: decent anti-inflammatory if used early enough some people have a rare mutation in p-glycoprotein transporters required to pump IVM out of the CNS, and IVM left there is neurotoxic Unless you have done full-genome sequencing and know you don’t have the mutation, not recommended, there are better solutions.
